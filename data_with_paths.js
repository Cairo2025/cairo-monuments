It is more commonly known as the wikala of Sulayman Agha, after the ‘Controller of Armies’ for Muhammad ‘Ali. Sulayman Agha probably purchased the property in the nineteenth century, along with other buildings in the area; his eponymous mosque (no. 382) is located to the east (map sheet 18). The entire ground floor of the wikala is in a good state of preservation. Shishini 维卡拉（商栈）是一座建于公元17世纪晚期的维卡拉，专为咖啡商人建造。它更常被称为苏莱曼·阿迦（Sulayman Agha）维卡拉，以穆罕默德·阿里（Muhammad ‘Ali）时期的“军队总监”命名。苏莱曼·阿迦可能在19世纪购买了这处房产以及该地区的其他建筑；以他名字命名的清真寺（编号382）位于东面（地图页18）。整个维卡拉的一层保存完好。",

Today it lies hidden beneath the surface of Shari‘ Amir al-Guyush at its junction with Midan al-Gaysh. A small section of the wall connecting to it, running north-south, can still be seen slightly to the north of the gateway’s location, which appears to have been almost totally rebuilt by the Comité (see no. 352 above). 坎塔拉门（Bab al-Qantara）是巴德尔·贾马利（Badr al-Gamali）城墙的一部分，1920年由阿基里斯·帕特里科洛（Achille Patricolo，委员会技术局局长）进行的挖掘工作使其部分显露。今天，它隐藏在阿米尔·古尤什街（Shari‘ Amir al-Guyush）与盖什广场（Midan al-Gaysh）交汇处的地表之下。在该门位置稍北处，仍可见连接它的一小段南北走向的城墙，该城墙似乎几乎完全由委员会重建（见上文编号352）。",

The gate is approximately three meters below ground level and consists of a simple pointed-arch stone vault; an inscription in marble attached to its face identifies Badr al-Gamali as its builder and gives the name of the gate and the date of its construction. A subsequent facing (also Fatimid) appears to have been added to the exterior of the vault to provide a machicoulis. The precise relationship between the Fatimid wall and the Ayyubid wall that runs a few meters to the east at this point can be resolved only through further excavation. 这座通往开罗的法蒂玛王朝城门于1960年出土。维耶（Wiet，1961）将其认定为巴基亚门（Bab al-Barqiya，编号614）。该门位于地平面以下约三米处，由一个简单的尖拱石拱顶组成；附在其表面的一块大理石铭文指明巴德尔·贾马利（Badr al-Gamali）是其建造者，并给出了门的名称和建造日期。随后的饰面（也是法蒂玛时期的）似乎被添加到了拱顶的外部，以提供一个防御突出的射孔（machicoulis）。此处法蒂玛城墙与向东延伸几米的阿尤布王朝城墙之间的确切关系，只能通过进一步的挖掘来解决。",

        "description": "This roughly semicircular defensive tower seems to lie on the line of the northeastern wall of Cairo originally constructed by Badr al-Gamali ca. AD 1087. The tower was probably part of Salah al-Din’s reconstruction of the walls of Badr al-Gamali before he undertook the project of building his own fortifications around the city in 1176. The French Expedition may have converted it to accommodate cannons in 1796. The tower is faced today in rough stonework with some dressed stone elements. It was given the number 17 in 1902 during the survey of the Ayyubid wall by the Austrian architect Edouard Matasek. 这座大致呈半圆形的防御塔似乎位于巴德尔·贾马利（Badr al-Gamali）约公元1087年最初建造的开罗东北城墙线上。该塔可能是萨拉赫·丁（Salah al-Din）重建巴德尔·贾马利城墙的一部分，之后他在1176年开始在城市周围建造自己的防御工事。法国远征军可能在1796年将其改建以容纳大炮。这座塔今天表面由粗糙的石制品和一些修整过的石材元素构成。在1902年奥地利建筑师爱德华·马塔塞克（Edouard Matasek）对阿尤布城墙进行勘测期间，它被赋予了编号17。",

The shaykh after whom the mosque is named is buried in a room to the north, although it seems likely that the tomb dates later than the mosque itself. 这座简朴的奥斯曼清真寺通过一个刻有铭文的三叶形石门进入，周围环绕着装饰性的带状纹饰。入口旁边是幸存的宣礼塔基座。清真寺本身（经过大幅翻新）由两个拱形拱廊组成，拱廊由带有科林斯柱头的大理石柱支撑。以其名字命名该清真寺的谢赫葬在北面的一个房间里，尽管墓的年代似乎晚于清真寺本身。",

The level of the foundation suggests that it may have been constructed during the nineteenth century, perhaps as part of the cemetery of al Ghurayib in this area, although the orientation of the building is not that of a tomb. It is included here principally to distinguish it from the adjacent wall, from which it is completely separate in time and space. 在该区域阿尤布城墙（见编号307）的挖掘过程中，发现了一个未确认的无窗石结构，其地层位置比城墙高得多。该结构呈拱形房间的形式，两侧各有两个拱形房间。地基的高度表明它可能建于19世纪，也许是该地区古赖布（al Ghurayib）公墓的一部分，尽管该建筑的朝向并非墓葬的朝向。将其列入此处主要是为了将其与相邻的城墙区分开来，两者在时间和空间上都是完全分离的。",

The stone floor and undecorated wooden coffered ceiling are in good condition, and there are high-level keel-arched niches that are stylistically similar to those seen in other seventeenth-century domestic structures. Beneath the maq‘ad are living units that also preserve their original decorated wooden ceilings. 这座建筑面向街道的一侧拥有完整的突挑石立面；其装饰有石制带状纹饰的入口通向一个严重恶化的庭院空间。庭院西侧是维卡拉遗留的两个石拱，而在街道一侧则有一个完好的马卡德（maq‘ad）。该马卡德有两个拱门，由一根设计独特的大理石中央柱支撑：柱身被雕刻成风格化的棕榈树状，顶部是饰有叶蓟、豹和鸟的复合柱头。石地板和未装饰的木制方格天花板状况良好，高处有龙骨拱壁龛，风格上与其他17世纪住宅结构中的壁龛相似。马卡德下方是生活单元，也保留了其原始的装饰木天花板。",

He moved the line of the original enclosure wall for the city of al-Qahira (built by Gawhar al-Siqilli in 969) out to its present position and employed stone for its construction rather than the bricks used by his predecessor. The Bab al-Futuh (‘the Gate of Conquests’) is a masterpiece of stonework and decorative detail, which has been exhaustively described by Creswell (1952). The ground level around the gate has risen considerably since its construction, leading to a false impression of its original vertical scale. The gate itself, as well as the section of wall between it and the Bab al Nasr, was restored between 2001 and 2003; urban clearance has taken place in the area immediately outside and a protective fence installed. A small, unidentified saint’s tomb is built within the doorway on its eastern flank. A round tower and a square stone tower containing a vast vaulted chamber, both built by Badr al-Gamali, are situated to the west of the gate. These towers are classified separately under no. 352. 这座城门与其对应的纳斯尔门（Bab al-Nasr，编号7）以及它们之间的城墙段（编号352），是由法蒂玛王朝的维齐尔巴德尔·贾马利（Badr al Gamali）于公元1087年建造的。他将卡希拉城（al-Qahira，由乔哈尔·西奇利于969年建立）的原始围墙线向外移至目前的位置，并使用石头代替前任使用的砖块进行建造。福图门（Bab al-Futuh，意为“征服之门”）是石造工艺和装饰细节的杰作，Creswell（1952）对此进行了详尽描述。自建造以来，城门周围的地面高度显著上升，导致人们对其原始垂直比例产生错误印象。城门本身以及它与纳斯尔门之间的城墙段在2001年至2003年间进行了修复；紧邻外侧的区域进行了城市清理并安装了防护栏。一个身份不明的小型圣人墓建在东侧的门道内。一座圆形塔楼和一座包含巨大拱形室的方形石塔（均为巴德尔·贾马利所建）位于城门西侧。这些塔楼被单独分类在编号352下。",

The same persistence of an older nomenclature applied to the Bab al Futuh, which was originally called the Bab al-Iqbal (‘the Gate of Prosperity’), but reverted to the name of the previous gate built by Gawhar. The square towers that flank the gate are decorated with heraldic shields carved in stone. A white marble inscription in kufic of the Shi‘a shahada (a very public proclamation of the Fatimid faith) is mounted above the portal. The gate was restored by the Comité at various times, and the latter organization also cleared the area outside the gate in the 1940s, removing the registered sabil of Salim Agha (no. [429]). The SCA undertook an extensive restoration of the Bab al-Nasr in 2001, which is yet to be completed at the time of writing. This has so far resulted in the replacement of many masonry elements. 纳斯尔门（Bab al-Nasr，意为“胜利之门”）在建筑上与其对应的福图门（Bab al-Futuh，编号6）的区别在于它拥有方形而非圆形的塔楼。它最初被命名为伊兹门（Bab al-Izz，意为“荣耀之门”），但很快就以开罗第一道城墙（现已拆除，由乔哈尔·西奇利在现址以南约两百米处建造）中的对应城门命名为纳斯尔门。这种旧名称的延续也发生在福图门上，它最初被称为伊克巴尔门（Bab al-Iqbal，意为“繁荣之门”），但也恢复了乔哈尔建造的前一道门的名称。大门两侧的方形塔楼装饰有石刻的纹章盾牌。门上方镶嵌着一块白色大理石，刻有库法体的什叶派清真言（Shahada，这是对法蒂玛信仰的非常公开的宣示）。该门曾多次由委员会修复，该组织还在1940年代清理了门外的区域，移除了已登记的萨利姆·阿迦（Salim Agha）萨比尔（编号[429]）。古物最高委员会（SCA）于2001年对纳斯尔门进行了广泛的修复，在撰写本文时尚未完成。到目前为止，这导致了许多砖石构件的更换。",

        "description": "This huge congregational mosque was started by the Fatimid khalif al-‘Aziz and completed by his son al-Hakim, who became one of the most notorious despots ever to rule Egypt. When started, the mosque occupied land outside the city walls built by Gawhar al-Siqilli, but it was subsequently included within the perimeter of the second set of walls built by Badr al Gamali (see no. 352). The building followed the precedent of the mosque of Ahmad ibn Tulun (no. 220), being constructed on the principle of arcades with piers and pointed arches and with a ziyada, or intermediate space, separating the interior of the mosque from the city around it. The mosque was restored after a great earthquake in AD 1302 by Baybars al Gashankir, who added the mabkharas to the original Fatimid minaret shafts. Sultan Hasan also restored the mosque in 1359, after which it fell into disuse and served variously as a prison, stables, fortress, and storehouse. During the last years of the nineteenth century it became home to Musée de l’Art Arabe prior to that institution’s relocation to the purpose built premises (U46) that it occupies (as the Islamic Museum) to this day. The Comité did much to reveal the true form of the minarets early in the twentieth century. The mosque remained largely ruined until major reconstruction took place in the 1980s directed by the Bohra Isma‘ili sect, which rebuilt all the arcades except for those on the qibla side, covered the sahn in marble, and remodeled the façade. In the course of the reconstruction, the mausoleum of Qurqumas (no. 170), originally situated immediately outside the entrance to the complex, was dismantled and reconstructed in the precincts of the funerary complex of Barsbay (monument no. 121) in the northern cemetery. 这座巨大的聚礼清真寺由法蒂玛哈里发阿齐兹（al-‘Aziz）动工，并由其子哈基姆（al-Hakim）完成，后者成为统治埃及的最臭名昭著的暴君之一。开工时，清真寺占据了乔哈尔·西奇利建造的城墙外的土地，但随后被纳入巴德尔·贾马利建造的第二道城墙范围内（见编号352）。该建筑遵循艾哈迈德·伊本·图伦清真寺（编号220）的先例，采用墩柱和尖拱构成的拱廊原则建造，并设有ziyada（外苑或中间空间），将清真寺内部与周围城市隔开。公元1302年大地震后，拜巴尔斯·加尚基尔（Baybars al Gashankir）修复了这座清真寺，并在原有的法蒂玛宣礼塔轴上增加了mabkharas（香炉状顶部结构）。苏丹哈桑也在1359年修复了这座清真寺，之后它便废弃不用，曾先后作为监狱、马厩、堡垒和仓库。在19世纪的最后几年，它成为了阿拉伯艺术博物馆的所在地，直到该机构迁至至今使用（作为伊斯兰博物馆）的专用场所（U46）。委员会在20世纪初为揭示宣礼塔的真实形态做了大量工作。直到1980年代在博拉伊斯玛仪派（Bohra Isma‘ili sect）的指导下进行大规模重建之前，该清真寺在很大程度上仍然是废墟。该教派重建了除基布拉侧以外的所有拱廊，用大理石覆盖了庭院（sahn），并改造了立面。在重建过程中，最初位于建筑群入口外的库尔库马斯陵墓（no. 170）被拆除，并在北部墓地的巴尔斯贝（Barsbay）葬礼建筑群（古迹编号121）范围内重建。",

It was constructed by the amir Almalik (‘the Orchard’) al-Gukandar, a mamluk of al-Zahir Baybars, who went on to serve Qalawun, al-Nasir Muhammad, and five of the latter’s sons. It was al-Nasir who made him a polomaster (gukandar). Almalik also founded an important madrasa in Jerusalem. On the eastern façade, a bull’s-eye window pierces the building’s original ablaq trilobed portal, which is no longer in use today. A new entrance into the mosque, which contains the tomb of Shaykh Hasan al-‘Adawi (AD 1806–86), was added onto the southern side of the building, presumably after the adjacent buildings to the south were destroyed in the general remodeling of the area around the mosque of al-Husayn. Almalik’s mosque has no minaret and no dome: the founder’s tomb is in a single, tunnel-vaulted room at the southeastern corner of the building. The interior is remarkable for its stucco decoration: an inscription band runs along the walls of the sahn and iwans, and medallions ornament the western iwan. 这是开罗已知最早的带有覆盖庭院的十字形伊斯兰学校（madrasa）的例子。它由埃米尔阿尔马利克（Almalik，意为“果园”）·古坎达尔建造，他是扎希尔·拜巴尔斯的一名马穆鲁克，后来继续为卡拉温、纳西尔·穆罕默德及其五个儿子服务。正是纳西尔任命他为马球总管（gukandar）。阿尔马利克还在耶路撒冷建立了一所重要的伊斯兰学校。在东立面上，一个牛眼窗穿透了该建筑原本的阿布拉格（ablaq）三叶形入口，该入口如今已不再使用。清真寺包含谢赫哈桑·阿达维（Shaykh Hasan al-‘Adawi，公元1806-86年）的陵墓，其南侧增设了一个新入口，大概是在南面相邻建筑在侯赛因清真寺周边地区的一般改造中被摧毁之后。阿尔马利克的清真寺没有宣礼塔也没有圆顶：创建者的墓位于建筑东南角的一个单间筒形拱顶房间内。内部以其灰泥装饰而著称：一条铭文带沿着庭院（sahn）和伊万（iwans）的墙壁延伸，圆章装饰着西面的伊万。",

The building is known also as the mosque of Umm al-Ghulam for this reason. The saints’ tombs are contained in an underground vault to the south of the main portal; a slab with kufic inscription (mounted inside on the qibla wall of the mosque) states that Fatima’s tomb was constructed in AD 1254 by the amir Bilbak al-Khazindar. The mosque is now approached from a modern extension to the west; the main trilobed arched portal to the east, with a pierced muqarnas hood, is shut. The mosque itself is a columnar structure, with arcades of reused columns and capitals arranged around an open sahn. The tomb of the founder is located to the north, on the side street. A sabil-kuttab, now lost, was apparently attached to the complex at its northeastern corner. 埃米尔塔克塔拜·伊本·巴尔德巴克（Taqtabay ibn Bardbak）的清真寺和陵墓建在法蒂玛（侯赛因之母）和另一位女性圣人的早期墓地之上。因此，该建筑也被称为Umm al-Ghulam清真寺。圣人的墓位于主入口以南的一个地下拱顶中；一块刻有库法体铭文的石板（安装在清真寺内的基布拉墙上）说明法蒂玛的墓是由埃米尔比尔巴克·哈津达尔（Bilbak al-Khazindar）于公元1254年建造的。清真寺现在从西面的现代扩建部分进入；东面带有穿孔穆卡纳斯罩的主要三叶形拱门已关闭。清真寺本身是一个柱式结构，由重复使用的柱子和柱头组成的拱廊围绕着一个开放的庭院。创建者的墓位于北面，在侧街上。一个现已消失的萨比尔-库塔布显然曾附属于该建筑群的东北角。",

The building was originally attached to a mosque of the same name, which was demolished in 1892. When the midan between the mosques of al-Azhar and al-Husayn was opened up in the 1930s, the Comité moved the sabil in 1935–36 to its present position, at some distance to the north and west of the original emplacement (see also no. 57, the sabil-kuttab of Isma‘il ibn Ahmad). The building is single story, having lost its kuttab (if it ever had one), and is noteworthy for its carved stone strapwork, with a decorative wood surround to the sabil grille. There are two portals: that to the east is blocked, and was originally in the same plane as the rest of the façade. It was reconstructed at right angles to the main façade because the new site that had been assigned to the building was obviously too small. Since this sabil and its neighbor (no. 57 below) were moved, they have been consistently confused with each other. It is hoped that the identification provided here will prevail. The building was restored in 2003 by the SCA. Raymond（1979）将这座无铭文萨比尔的建造日期定为公元1640-41年（在古迹索引中被列为“17世纪中叶”）。该建筑最初附属于一座同名清真寺，后者于1892年被拆除。当爱资哈尔清真寺和侯赛因清真寺之间的广场在1930年代开辟时，委员会于1935-36年将萨比尔移至目前的位置，位于原址西北方一定距离处（另见编号57，伊斯梅尔·伊本·艾哈迈德的萨比尔-库塔布）。该建筑为单层，失去了它的库塔布（如果曾经有过的话），并因其雕刻的石制带状纹饰以及萨比尔格栅周围的装饰性木框而引人注目。有两个入口：东面的那个被封堵，原本与立面的其余部分处于同一平面。由于分配给该建筑的新场地明显太小，它被重建为与主立面成直角。自从这个萨比尔和它的邻居（下文编号57）被移动后，它们一直被混淆。希望此处提供的鉴定能够正本清源。该建筑于2003年由古物最高委员会（SCA）修复。",

The head was first buried in a mashhad on this site by the Fatimid khalif al-Fa‘iz in AD 1154, and the building was reconstructed by Salih Negm al-Din Ayyub in 1237, only to be burnt down eleven years later. Subsequent restorations included those of Hasan Katkhuda al-Galfi in the early eighteenth century, ‘Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda later in the same century, and Khedive Isma‘il in the nineteenth century. The immediate environs of the tomb were subjected to major urban clearance in the mid-twentieth century. The existing mosque was designed, on the instructions of khedives ‘Abbas I and Isma‘il, in the neo-Gothic style. It was completed in 1873, with the exception of the new minaret, which was finished in 1878. A further matching extension that enlarged the area of the mosque was built in the 1950s. The only parts of the structure that are listed monuments today are the Ayyubid minaret, with fine original stucco decoration dating to 1237, and the gate directly beneath it, which was formerly called the Bab al-Hasanayn and is today called the Bab al-Akhdar. Portions of this gate may date to the original Fatimid foundation of 1154. The tomb chamber (the work of ‘Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda) was the object of a major restoration in 1985 supervised by the Egyptian Antiquities Organisation, during which a replacement dome made of steel was placed over it. For this reason, this section of the building is also shown on the map highlighted as if it were a registered monument, although it is not formally listed. 据说阿里的殉难之子侯赛因的头颅葬于此，该地点至今仍是开罗最重要的朝圣地。头颅最初于公元1154年由法蒂玛哈里发法伊兹（al-Fa‘iz）葬于此地的圣地（mashhad），该建筑于1237年由萨利赫·内格姆·丁·阿尤布（Salih Negm al-Din Ayyub）重建，但仅在11年后就被烧毁。随后的修复包括18世纪初的哈桑·卡特胡达·加尔菲（Hasan Katkhuda al-Galfi）、同世纪后期的阿卜杜勒·拉赫曼·卡特胡达以及19世纪的赫迪夫·伊斯梅尔。陵墓的紧邻环境在20世纪中叶经历了大规模的城市清理。现存的清真寺是根据赫迪夫阿巴斯一世和伊斯梅尔的指示，以新哥特式风格设计的。除新宣礼塔于1878年完工外，其余部分于1873年完工。1950年代又建造了一个扩建清真寺面积的配套建筑。该结构中唯一列为古迹的部分是阿尤布宣礼塔（拥有可追溯到1237年的精美原始灰泥装饰）及其正下方的门，该门原名哈萨奈因门（Bab al-Hasanayn），现称阿赫达尔门（Bab al-Akhdar）。这扇门的部分构件可能追溯到1154年的原始法蒂玛地基。墓室（阿卜杜勒·拉赫曼·卡特胡达的作品）是1985年由埃及古物组织监督的一项重大修复工程的对象，期间在其上方放置了一个钢制的替代圆顶。因此，尽管该建筑部分未正式列入名录，但在地图上也将其高亮显示，仿佛是已登记的古迹。",

The entrance to the site, currently occupied by a school, is through a neo-Mamluk portal. 这座陵墓是由苏丹卡拉温的马穆鲁克卡拉松古尔（Qarasunqur，意为“黑隼”）与一所伊斯兰学校结合建造的。该建筑群最初被委员会认为是阿克松古尔（Aqsunqur）的建筑群，不可与达尔布·艾哈迈尔的阿克松古尔实际地基（编号123）混淆。只有陵墓和伊斯兰学校的立面幸存下来。陵墓的大理石和木材镶嵌米哈拉布由委员会修复，是开罗最丰富的米哈拉布之一。立面保留了许多精美的石制细节，特别是在窗楣上。进入该地点（目前被一所学校占用）需通过一个新马穆鲁克式入口。",

        "description": "Baybars al-Gashankir (‘the Taster’), who became sultan for a year by temporarily deposing al-Nasir Muhammad, was also responsible for building the tops on the minarets of the nearby mosque of al-Hakim (no. 15). He was subsequently executed by al-Nasir Muhammad, who proceeded to obliterate his enemy’s name from the inscription band on the façade of the khanqah. Three elements of the complex are visible from the street: the minaret, portal, and tomb chamber. The minaret rises from a square base with a heavy muqarnas cornice, above which is set a circular second tier and mabkhara. The recess of the portal is framed, unusually, by a round-headed arch with cushion voussoirs, behind which stands the doorway itself, surmounted by a more conventional combination of semi-dome and muqarnas pendentives. The doors retain their fine metal revetments; the granite threshold is a reused piece of pharaonic spolia. Construction took place in two phases, with the mausoleum being added to the rest of the complex; this may account for the two separate dog-legged corridors leading from the vestibule beyond the portal to the tomb chamber and to the courtyard. The tomb chamber is preceded by another vestibule and is decorated with a marble dado, inlaid marble mihrab, and wooden inscription band. The plan of the khanqah is essentially cruciform, but the lateral iwans are here so compressed as to have minimal architectural impact. Instead, attention is drawn to the qibla and western iwans, which are large pointed-arch vaults. The western iwan has a malqaf incorporated into its rear wall; the qibla wall is undecorated. The flank walls of the sahn are occupied by three levels of accommodation for the Sufi students of the khanqah. The ancillary buildings to the south of the sahn, such as the kitchens, have largely disappeared, but the surviving endowment deed for the complex provides detailed information as to how the khanqah functioned. 拜巴尔斯·加尚基尔（Baybars al-Gashankir，意为“尝膳官”）曾通过暂时废黜纳西尔·穆罕默德而做了一年的苏丹，他也负责建造了附近的哈基姆清真寺（编号15）宣礼塔的顶部。他随后被纳西尔·穆罕默德处决，后者继而将他敌人的名字从汗卡立面的铭文带上抹去。从街道上可以看到建筑群的三个要素：宣礼塔、入口和墓室。宣礼塔从一个带有厚重穆卡纳斯飞檐的方形基座升起，上方是圆形的第二层和香炉状顶部（mabkhara）。入口的凹处不寻常地由一个带有垫状拱石的圆头拱框住，后面是门口本身，上方是更传统的半圆顶和穆卡纳斯帆拱组合。门保留了精美的金属饰面；花岗岩门槛是一块被重新利用的法老时期遗物。建造分两个阶段进行，陵墓是被添加到建筑群其余部分的；这可能解释了为何有两条分开的折角走廊从入口后的前厅通往墓室和庭院。墓室前面还有另一个前厅，装饰有大理石护壁、镶嵌大理石米哈拉布和木制铭文带。汗卡的平面本质上是十字形的，但侧面的伊万在这里被压缩得对建筑影响极小。相反，注意力被吸引到基布拉和西面的伊万，它们是巨大的尖拱拱顶。西面的伊万后墙结合了一个捕风塔；基布拉墙未作装饰。庭院的侧墙被汗卡苏菲派学生的三层住宿占据。庭院南面的附属建筑（如厨房）已基本消失，但现存的建筑群捐赠契约提供了关于汗卡如何运作的详细信息。",

        "description": "Founded by al-Ma’mun al-Bata‘ihi, the vizier of the Fatimid khalif al-Amir, this tiny mosque (nicknamed ‘the Moonlit’), has generated a considerable body of literature, not least because it was the first mosque in Cairo to have dual orientation: i.e., to the street on the outside and to the qibla within. It also has a remarkable decorated façade with a complex iconography related to Isma‘ili Shi‘a doctrine. The open sahn is surrounded by keel-arched arcades, supported by reused marble columns or, at the corners, by brick piers. Decoration is in the form of stucco inscription bands, which run along each arch, alternating with medallions. Most of what can be seen of the decoration today is a modern replacement. The building has undergone three major restorations in its history. The first of these was carried out by the amir Yalbugha (a mamluk of Barquq) in AD 1396. The second was executed by the Comité under the direction of Max Herz at the beginning of the twentieth century (including the partial clearance of encroachments from both inside and outside the mosque). The last restoration was that of the Bohra Isma‘ili sect in the 1990s, during which the southern half of the façade was rebuilt and much of the mosque’s decoration replaced. 这座小巧的清真寺（昵称“月光”，al-Aqmar）由法蒂玛哈里发阿米尔的维齐尔马蒙·巴塔伊希（al-Ma’mun al-Bata‘ihi）建立，它产生了大量的文献，不仅因为它是开罗第一座具有双重朝向（即外部面向街道，内部面向麦加基布拉）的清真寺。它还有一个非凡的装饰立面，带有与伊斯玛仪什叶派教义相关的复杂图像。开放的庭院被龙骨拱拱廊环绕，由重新利用的大理石柱支撑，或在角落由砖墩支撑。装饰形式为沿着每个拱门延伸的灰泥铭文带，与圆章交替。今天所能看到的大部分装饰都是现代替代品。该建筑在历史上经历了三次重大修复。第一次由埃米尔亚尔布加（Yalbugha，巴尔库克的马穆鲁克）于公元1396年进行。第二次由委员会在Max Herz的指导下于20世纪初执行（包括部分清除清真寺内外的侵占物）。最后一次修复是博拉伊斯玛仪派在1990年代进行的，期间重建了立面的南半部分，并更换了清真寺的大部分装饰。",

The stone dog-legged passageway to the south of the building has groin vaults and was at one time listed separately (see no. 47). 这座巨大的多层石制宫殿由苏丹纳西尔·穆罕默德的一位显赫埃米尔建在法蒂玛东宫的旧址上。巴什塔克（Bashtak）宫殿的遗迹包括清真寺、庭院、马厩和一楼的一个巨大卡阿（qa‘a，正厅）。这间正厅有四个伊万，一个方格木天花板，以及位于高处的内部马什拉比耶，前面是一个歌手的走廊。清真寺的主入口位于穆伊兹·利丁·安拉街（Shari‘ Mu‘izz li-Din Allah），也被称为“al-Figl”。该建筑于1982-84年由德国研究所部分修复，并于2003年等待进一步修复。建筑南侧的石制折角通道有交叉拱顶，曾一度被单独列出（见编号47）。",

The building is entered through a portal on the north that has a crenellated muqarnas cornice and inscription plaque above it. At the center of the mosque is an open courtyard with a geometric marble pavement, around which are three iwans; a fine stucco inscription band encircles the courtyard and iwans. Of the two mihrabs, that in the larger, southern iwan is decorated with marble revetments and an inscription band; its counterpart has a simple stucco hood. The ceilings of the iwan are richly painted and framed by high-level inscription bands. The original minbar of the foundation is now in the Islamic Museum. The top story of the minaret is missing; the remaining tiers are both inscribed. The restoration of this complex was completed in 1982 by the German Institute. 该建筑群由苏丹纳西尔·穆罕默德的长女建立，她于公元1360年死于鼠疫。她仍受尊崇的陵墓拥有一个肋状石圆顶，基部有一条铭文带。建筑通过北面的一个入口进入，入口上方有齿状穆卡纳斯飞檐和铭文牌匾。清真寺中心是一个铺有几何大理石地面的开放庭院，周围有三个伊万；一条精美的灰泥铭文带环绕着庭院和伊万。在两个米哈拉布中，较大的南面伊万中的那个装饰有大理石饰面和铭文带；相对应的另一个则有一个简单的灰泥罩。伊万的天花板绘有丰富的彩画，并由高处的铭文带框住。该地基的原始敏巴尔（讲坛）现在位于伊斯兰博物馆。宣礼塔的顶层已缺失；其余层均刻有铭文。该建筑群的修复工作于1982年由德国研究所完成。",

        "description": "The madrasa of Salih Negm al-Din Ayyub—the first madrasa built in Egypt to accommodate all four schools of jurisprudence—is split into two roughly equivalent sections separated by a street that passes directly under the minaret of the complex. These two sections of the madrasa are linked by a common façade, which has the minaret at its approximate center. The tomb was a later addition to this madrasa, built in AD 1249 by Sultan Negm al-Din Ayyub’s wife, Shagarat al-Durr, but it established the much-followed precedent of building a tomb in association with a madrasa. The façade and the minaret of the complex were restored by the Comité at various times. The German Institute restored the tomb and the minaret of the complex in 1993–95. Despite considerable intrusive development, the northern section of the madrasa still retains its western iwan and the base of the eastern iwan. The southern section of the madrasa has been entirely demolished and the land that it occupied is, in 2004, a building site awaiting new construction. An archaeological investigation in 1995 revealed that Creswell’s reconstruction of this part of the complex, which rested on the remains of the Fatimid Eastern Palace, was substantially correct. At the extreme northern end of the complex stands the founder’s tomb. This has a dome of plastered brick, while more costly materials are reserved for the interior. A stucco inscription band runs along the walls; the mihrab preserves the first documented use of glass mosaic decoration in Muslim Egypt; the tabut over the grave, and other wooden elements, are finely carved. 萨利赫·内格姆·丁·阿尤布（Salih Negm al-Din Ayyub）的伊斯兰学校是埃及建造的第一所容纳所有四个法学派别的伊斯兰学校，它被一条直接从建筑群宣礼塔下方穿过的街道分成大致相当的两部分。这两部分由一个共同的立面连接，宣礼塔大致位于其中心。陵墓是这所伊斯兰学校的后期增建部分，由苏丹内格姆·丁·阿尤布的妻子沙格拉特·杜尔（Shagarat al-Durr）于公元1249年建造，但它确立了将陵墓与伊斯兰学校联合建造的广受遵循的先例。该建筑群的立面和宣礼塔曾多次由委员会修复。德国研究所于1993-95年修复了该建筑群的陵墓和宣礼塔。尽管有相当多的侵入性开发，伊斯兰学校的北段仍保留了其西面的伊万和东面伊万的基座。伊斯兰学校的南段已被完全拆除，其占据的土地在2004年是一个等待新建筑的工地。1995年的一项考古调查显示，Creswell对该建筑群这一部分的重建（基于法蒂玛东宫的遗迹）基本正确。在建筑群的最北端矗立着创建者的陵墓。它有一个灰泥砖圆顶，而更昂贵的材料则保留用于内部。一条灰泥铭文带沿着墙壁延伸；米哈拉布保留了穆斯林埃及首次有记载使用的玻璃马赛克装饰；坟墓上的棺椁（tabut）和其他木制元素雕刻精美。",

The mosque is approached through a finely decorated trilobed portal, flanked to the north by the sabil-kuttab, which in elevation is identical to ‘Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda’s other, three-sided sabil-kuttab further down the Bayn al-Qasrayn (no. 21). The corridor from the street has a stone flanking wall and two open courts, and is preceded by a small arched annex, also used for prayer. The mosque itself has plain arched stone arcades and an inlaid marble mihrab; the tomb chamber is situated to the west of the mosque. 这座清真寺由阿卜杜勒·拉赫曼·卡特胡达建造，以纪念葬于此处的谢赫阿里·穆塔哈尔（‘Ali al-Mutahhar）；根据Creswell（1922）的说法，这位谢赫直到公元1776-77年才去世，这意味着他的墓是提前很久建造的。据称阿卜杜勒·拉赫曼·卡特胡达的母亲葬在谢赫的圆顶墓室旁边。该地点以前曾是马蒙·巴塔伊希（阿克马尔清真寺的建造者）的住宅，随后是一所阿尤布王朝的伊斯兰学校。该建筑的历史部分分为三个独立的实体：1. 入口、宣礼塔和萨比尔-库塔布；2. 走廊和拱形附楼；3. 清真寺主体和墓室。清真寺通过一个装饰精美的三叶形入口进入，北面是萨比尔-库塔布，其立面与阿卜杜勒·拉赫曼·卡特胡达在拜因·盖斯林（Bayn al-Qasrayn）更远处的另一个三面萨比尔-库塔布（编号21）完全相同。来自街道的走廊有一面石侧墙和两个开放式庭院，前面是一个小型的拱形附楼，也用于祈祷。清真寺本身有朴素的拱形石拱廊和一个镶嵌大理石的米哈拉布；墓室位于清真寺的西面。",

This remarkable group of buildings was begun and completed in only a year by the first of the Bahri Mamluk sultans: al-Mansur Qalawun; it is the earliest of a series of foundations built by successive sultans on the western side of Bayn al-Qasrayn. The mausoleum is remarkable for its size, its unique façade, and the wealth of ornamentation in its interior. It is approached by an imposing corridor that also gives access to the madrasa and used to lead into the bimaristan (now blocked). The mausoleum is preceded by a small courtyard lined with reused antique columns. The dome above the tomb chamber, supported on an octagonal arrangement of columns reminiscent of a baptistery, is a replacement in concrete by the Comité, modeled on the almost contemporaneous dome of the mausoleum of al-Ashraf Khalil (monument no. 275). The adjacent madrasa, noteworthy for the unique navelike design of the qibla iwan, was also heavily restored by the Comité. The remains of the bimaristan, the first hospital built in Cairo, are today accessed by a road to the south of the madrasa. Only peripheral fragments of this once-large structure remain, including a qa‘a built by one of the later directors of the hospital, the amir Aqqush, in AD 1320–30.

        "description": "Started by Sultan Kitbugha and completed by Sultan al-Nasir Muhammad, this is the first cruciform madrasa to be built in Cairo with the express intention of housing all four schools of jurisprudence. The complex is distinguished on the street by its portal, which was taken from the Crusader cathedral at Acre, and its carved stucco minaret. Beneath this, a corridor leads into the sahn, which contains a large stone basin. To the south of the corridor, the qibla iwan of the madrasa preserves a ten-meter-high mihrab with a carved stucco hood. To the north lies the tomb chamber, where two painted wood inscription bands at high level survive. Al-Nasir’s son, Anuk (d. AD 1340), is buried here, while al-Nasir himself is interred next door in his father Qalawun’s mausoleum (no. 43). The dome over the tomb collapsed in 1870 and has never been replaced. The complex was restored by the German Institute in 1985–86 (the portal was conserved and restored in 1999–2000), and the remains of an ablutions court in the southwestern corner of the site were first excavated in 1998. Since 2002 the complex has been closed for further restoration by the SCA. 该建筑由苏丹基特布加（Kitbugha）动工，苏丹纳西尔·穆罕默德完成，是开罗建造的第一所明确旨在容纳所有四个法学派别的十字形伊斯兰学校。该建筑群在街道上以其取自阿克（Acre）十字军大教堂的入口大门和雕刻灰泥宣礼塔而著称。在其下方，一条走廊通向包含一个大石盆的庭院（sahn）。走廊以南，伊斯兰学校的基布拉伊万保留了一个十米高的米哈拉布，带有雕刻灰泥罩。北面是墓室，那里保留了两条高处的彩绘木铭文带。纳西尔的儿子阿努克（死于公元1340年）葬于此，而纳西尔本人则葬在隔壁他父亲卡拉温的陵墓（编号43）中。墓上方的圆顶于1870年坍塌，从未更换。该建筑群于1985-86年由德国研究所修复（入口大门于1999-2000年进行了保护和修复），遗址西南角的沐浴庭院遗迹于1998年首次被挖掘出来。自2002年以来，该建筑群已关闭，由古物最高委员会（SCA）进行进一步修复。",

A marble panel with a foundation inscription and date is located above the sabil grille on the western façade, however, which names the founder as Isma‘il ibn Ahmad. This name is accordingly used here. The sabil-kuttab was moved in its entirety in 1935–36 (like the sabil of al-Bazdar [no. 27]) from its original position, where the Midan al-Husayn is today. The sabil has a fine painted wooden ceiling and the whole structure has been recently restored by the SCA (2003). The building is still confused with its neighbor (al-Bazdar), not only in the Map of Mohammedan Monuments where the labelings are unclear, but also on the ground (see SCA 2002). This confusion is evident in the fact that the building also bears a metal plaque identifying it as number 27. The inscription, however, is clear enough to permit a final attribution and identification to be made. 这个萨比尔-库塔布的通称是马格拉维（al-Maghlawi），而创建者在古迹索引中被称为伊斯梅尔·马纳维（Isma‘il al-Manawi）。然而，西立面萨比尔格栅上方有一块带有奠基铭文和日期的大理石板，将创建者命名为伊斯梅尔·伊本·艾哈迈德（Isma‘il ibn Ahmad）。因此这里使用这个名字。该萨比尔-库塔布于1935-36年（像巴兹达尔萨比尔[编号27]一样）从原址（即今天的侯赛因广场）整体搬迁。萨比尔拥有精美的彩绘木天花板，整个结构最近由古物最高委员会（SCA）修复（2003年）。该建筑仍经常与其邻居（巴兹达尔）混淆，不仅在标记不清的穆罕默德古迹地图上，而且在实地也是如此（见SCA 2002）。这种混淆显而易见，因为该建筑还带有一块金属牌匾，将其标识为编号27。然而，铭文足够清晰，可以做出最终的归属和鉴定。",

The mausoleum’s interior is decorated with polychrome arabesque painting, which also covers the vault of the dome. To the south of the mausoleum is a fine Ottoman stone house-façade, with another tomb (probably that of al Sha‘rani’s son) behind it.

Before this, he had endowed not only a fine mosque in Cairo but also madrasas in Jerusalem, Mecca, and Damascus. His foundation in Cairo takes the form of a cruciform madrasa with two stone portals, a minaret, and a sabil-kuttab. The decorative stone and wood elements throughout are of high quality. It was restored at various times by the Comité, but most of the building is orginal. In 2003 the mosque was still undergoing a lengthy conservation. Immediately opposite the eastern façade of the mosque stood the monumental entrace to the nineteenth-century palace of the al-Bakri family, seen in a photograph published by Pauty (1933a, pl. viib). This was demolished in the 1950s and replaced with modern school buildings. 阿卜杜勒·巴西特（‘Abd al-Basit）是苏丹穆阿亚德·谢赫统治时期的军队总监；然而，随着苏丹巴尔斯贝的继位，他的影响力下降，苏丹巴尔库克（注：此处原文“Sultan Barquq”有误，应为当时的苏丹，因巴尔库克死于1399年，1450年时为苏丹贾克马克）于公元1450年将其处决。在此之前，他不仅在开罗捐赠了一座精美的清真寺，还在耶路撒冷、麦加和大马士革建立了伊斯兰学校。他在开罗的地基采用十字形伊斯兰学校的形式，有两个石门、一座宣礼塔和一个萨比尔-库塔布。各处的装饰性石木元素品质极高。它曾多次由委员会修复，但大部分建筑是原物。2003年，清真寺仍在进行漫长的保护工作。就在清真寺东立面的正对面，曾矗立着19世纪巴克里（al-Bakri）家族宫殿的宏伟入口，见Pauty（1933a，图版viib）发表的照片。这在1950年代被拆除，取而代之的是现代学校建筑。",

        "description": "Founded by the Fatimids as the principal congregational mosque of the royal city of al-Qahira, the mosque of al-Azhar (‘the Shining’) has undergone numerous additions and extensions over time. It has functioned as a teaching center more or less since its foundation, attracting students from all parts of the Islamic world. The most notable surviving Fatimid components of the mosque are the keel-arches in the courtyard, the dome behind the central arch of the courtyard on the qibla side, and the stucco conch of the mihrab on the central axis. During the Mamluk period, individually dedicated madrasas were added to the north and west of the main courtyard. To the southwest lies the madrasa of the amir Taybars (AD 1309), whose fine marble inlaid mihrab survives. To the northwest lies the madrasa of the amir Aqbugha, with its adjacent domed tomb chamber and minaret (1333–39). To the northeast is the small but finely decorated madrasa of the eunuch Gawhar (the treasurer of Sultan Barsbay), whose tomb here is adorned with a carved masonry dome (1440). Sultan Qaytbay built a gateway (1468) and minaret (ca. 1495) on the central axis to the west of the courtyard. The largest minaret of the mosque was added by Sultan al-Ghuri in 1510; it contains a double-helix spiral stair and is topped by a two finials that are square in plan. During the Ottoman period, ‘Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda significantly enlarged the riwaqs on the qibla side and added (in 1751–52) two distinctive double-arched gateways to the southern and western perimeters, another portal on the east, and three minarets (two of which survive). His tomb is located on the southeastern side of the mosque. At the beginning of the twentieth century, Khedive ‘Abbas II Hilmi built a large extension to house the students and a library on the southern and western sides of the complex. The original context for the mosque, and its ancient ablutions area, were destroyed from the 1930s onward by the development of Shari‘ al-Azhar as a major thoroughfare and by the creation of the new al-Azhar University campus to the east of the mosque. The entire mosque was heavily restored and cleaned in 1998–2000. 爱资哈尔（al-Azhar，“光辉”）清真寺由法蒂玛王朝建立，作为皇城卡希拉（al-Qahira）的主要聚礼清真寺，随着时间的推移经历了无数次的增建和扩建。自成立以来，它或多或少一直作为教学中心运作，吸引了来自伊斯兰世界各地的学生。清真寺最著名的幸存法蒂玛构件是庭院中的龙骨拱、基布拉一侧庭院中央拱门后的圆顶以及中轴线上米哈拉布的灰泥半圆顶。在马穆鲁克时期，单独献纳的伊斯兰学校被添加到主庭院的北面和西面。西南方是埃米尔泰巴尔斯（Taybars）伊斯兰学校（公元1309年），其精美的大理石镶嵌米哈拉布幸存下来。西北方是埃米尔阿克布加（Aqbugha）伊斯兰学校，及其相邻的圆顶墓室和宣礼塔（1333-39年）。东北方是太监乔哈尔（Gawhar，苏丹巴尔斯贝的财政官）的小型但装饰精美的伊斯兰学校，他在那里的墓装饰有雕刻砌体圆顶（1440年）。苏丹盖特贝在庭院西侧的中轴线上建造了一个大门（1468年）和宣礼塔（约1495年）。清真寺最大的宣礼塔由苏丹古里于1510年增建；它包含一个双螺旋楼梯，顶部有两个方形平面的尖顶。在奥斯曼时期，阿卜杜勒·拉赫曼·卡特胡达显着扩大了基布拉一侧的回廊（riwaqs），并增加了（1751-52年）两个独特的双拱门到南部和西部周边，另一个入口在东部，以及三座宣礼塔（其中两座幸存）。他的墓位于清真寺的东南侧。20世纪初，赫迪夫阿巴斯二世·希尔米在建筑群的南侧和西侧建造了一个大型扩建部分，以容纳学生和图书馆。清真寺的原始环境及其古老的沐浴区自1930年代起因爱资哈尔街作为主要通道的发展以及清真寺以东新爱资哈尔大学校园的建立而被破坏。整个清真寺在1998-2000年间进行了大力修复和清洁。",

This magnificent complex, which includes a tomb and library as well as a sabil and a watering trough (listed separately: see no. 62), is one of the most impressive eighteenth-century structures in Cairo. Built on a raised platform, with shops beneath, the mosque has a screen wall to the north, and a shallow domed arcade to the north, south, and west of the large central dome that covers the prayer-space. The minaret is freestanding, with square tiers. The ablutions area is located in part of the complex known as the takiya of Abu’l Dhahab (U27) that was built to the west early in the twentieth century. 穆罕默德·贝伊·阿布·扎哈布（Muhammad Bey Abu’l Dhahab）在公元1772年推翻其主人阿里·贝伊·卡比尔（‘Ali Bey al-Kabir）后统治埃及四年。这座宏伟的建筑群包括陵墓和图书馆以及萨比尔和饮水槽（单独列出：见编号62），是开罗最令人印象深刻的18世纪建筑之一。清真寺建在高台上，下面是商店，北面有一面屏墙，覆盖祈祷空间的巨大中央圆顶的北、南、西三面有浅圆顶拱廊。宣礼塔是独立的，具有方形层级。沐浴区位于20世纪初在西面建造的被称为阿布·扎哈布塔基亚（U27）的建筑群部分。",

He died in AD 1451, having already restored his own complex, which included his tomb, in 1431. The northern and eastern façades of this mosque give the appearance of being modern, but the stone may merely have been plastered and false-pointed. There is an inscription band on the entry portal at the eastern façade. The main part of the mosque consists of a qa‘a to the north of the entrance; its interior has been heavily painted, and the mihrab’s original tiles, for which the mosque was famous, have also been overpainted or destroyed. Off this room lies the tomb chamber, which has beautiful painted wood muqarnas squinches. 这座清真寺是为一位显赫的哈纳菲法官建造的，他曾为三位苏丹服务：巴尔库克、穆阿亚德·谢赫和巴尔斯贝。他于公元1451年去世，已在1431年修复了他自己的建筑群（包括他的墓）。这座清真寺的北立面和东立面看起来是现代的，但石材可能只是被抹灰和假勾缝了。东立面的入口大门上有一条铭文带。清真寺的主体部分由入口北面的一个卡阿（qa‘a）组成；其内部已被严重重绘，清真寺闻名的米哈拉布原始瓷砖也被重绘覆盖或破坏。在这个房间旁边是墓室，拥有美丽的彩绘木穆卡纳斯抹角拱。",

He died in 1427. A fine inscription band runs across the mosque’s northern and eastern façades. The physical evidence suggests that the eastern façade originally continued some way to the south. The main portal has inlaid marble geometric kufic panels as well as a lower-level stone inscription. The building’s plan is cruciform, with greatly abbreviated lateral iwans. The courtyard was once covered; little of the roof survives, but a high-level inscription band with the blazon of the founder is still visible. The qibla iwan’s painted wood ceiling, raised on large wooden squinches, is almost certainly a later addition, for it cuts across the windows in the façade. An Ottoman sabil-kuttab, which has two fine stone corbels, stands adjacent to the northwestern corner of the building.

There are three inscription bands on the main portal on the southern façade and on the subsidiary portal on the western façade. The ribbed plastered-brick dome over the tomb chamber is in good condition, with a rare tile-mosaic inscription band that is largely intact on the northern side of the drum (the complementary inscription band, on the drums’s south, is entirely missing). Only the lower story of the minaret is original. The sahn, probably open originally, was roofed by the Comité with a steel structure. The painted ceilings of the qibla and south iwans are intact; those in the other iwans are recent replacements. A wooden inscription band (most of it illegible or replaced, except in the qibla iwan) runs across the interior. The mihrab of the mosque is plain, with a few fragments of the original marble revetment in place, and that in the tomb chamber has a fine stucco hood. A wooden dikka occupies the western iwan. 亚斯拉姆（Aslam，苏丹纳西尔·穆罕默德的持剑官）很可能首先在遗址上建造了他的墓，随后建造了清真寺，因为该墓拥有一个现在位于清真寺内部的高度装饰的阿布拉格入口。清真寺的南立面由委员会进行了大力重建，使用了大面积的新石方和新城垛。在南立面的主入口和西立面的次要入口上有三条铭文带。墓室上方的肋状灰泥砖圆顶状况良好，带有一个罕见的瓷砖马赛克铭文带，在鼓座的北侧基本完好（鼓座南侧的互补铭文带完全缺失）。只有宣礼塔的下层是原物。庭院（sahn）最初可能是开放的，被委员会用钢结构加了屋顶。基布拉伊万和南伊万的彩绘天花板完好无损；其他伊万的天花板是近期的替代品。一条木制铭文带（除基布拉伊万外，大部分已难以辨认或被更换）贯穿内部。清真寺的米哈拉布朴素无华，只剩下几块原有的石材饰面碎片，而墓室内的米哈拉布有一个精美的灰泥罩。一个木制迪卡（dikka，诵经台）占据了西面的伊万。",

The founder, an important amir of Sultan Qaytbay, died in Damascus. The mosque is built on a triangular plot, and is connected by a bridge to its ablutions court on the other side of a street to the northwest. It is one of the most lavishly decorated of the Qaytbay-period monuments and was heavily restored by the Comité in 1896. It would seem that the listing does not extend to the hawd (occupied by a shop) and kuttab (still in use as a school) also on the other side of the street to the northwest. The complex takes the form of a cruciform madrasa, with a sabil, minaret, dome over the tomb chamber, and two portals. The main portal faces west and is embellished with ablaq decoration (also found over the window heads). The secondary portal (on the eastern façade) is today disused. The whole building is constructed above shop units, which are today substantially underground. The sabil (which has a separate access from the street) is derelict, but a fine salsabil with wooden muqarnas hood and a painted wood ceiling is preserved within. 这座清真寺更常以谢赫阿布·胡莱拉（Abu Hurayra）或哈里巴（Hariba）的名字为人所知，他于19世纪葬于此。创建者是苏丹盖特贝的一位重要埃米尔，死于大马士革。清真寺建在一个三角形地块上，并通过一座桥连接到西北面街道对面的沐浴庭院。它是盖特贝时期装饰最奢华的古迹之一，并于1896年由委员会进行了大力修复。名录似乎并未延伸至西北面街道另一侧的饮水槽（hawd，被商店占用）和库塔布（仍用作学校）。该建筑群采用十字形伊斯兰学校的形式，设有一个萨比尔、宣礼塔、墓室圆顶和两个入口。主入口朝西，饰有阿布拉格装饰（也见于窗头上方）。次要入口（在东立面）如今已废弃。整座建筑建在商店单元之上，这些商店今天基本上处于地下。萨比尔（有一个从街道进入的单独入口）已废弃，但内部保留了一个带有木制穆卡纳斯罩的精美萨尔萨比尔和一个彩绘木天花板。",

The building, an early example of a mosque built above shop units, takes the form of a courtyard surrounded by arcades of antique columns. The ground level around the building has risen by two to three meters since its construction; the entire structure is now surrounded by an artificial trench that allows access to the shop units (some of which are still in use). The interior is approached through an unusual portico of keel-arches (a Comité reconstruction) supported on antique columns. The mashrabiya screens to either side of the portico are copies of the original maqsura screens (now in the Islamic Museum), as are the bronze-plated doors. There are two subsidiary entrances on the northern and southern façades. The most significant restoration work carried out on the mosque was executed by the Comité in the 1920s and 1930s, when the building was disengaged from the accretive structures that surrounded it and most of the façades entirely reconstructed. The original arcades are those on the qibla side: the lateral arcades and the western, or entry, arcade are reconstructions by the Comité, which rebuilt much of the mosque to conform to their idea of what such a Fatimid mosque should look like. During this process, a Mamluk replacement for the northern arcade and a Mamluk/Ottoman minaret were demolished. The keel-arches of the qibla riwaqs are decorated with a band of carved stucco inscription around their perimeter, and they are connected to one another with carved wood tie-beams. Little of the Mamluk mihrab’s decoration survives. The fine wooden minbar with panels of geometric decoration, endowed on the mosque in AD 1300 by the amir Baktimur al-Gukandar, was restored in 1998 by the EAP. Subsequent to this, another (extremely heavy) restoration of the entire building has been carried out by the SCA. 这座清真寺由法蒂玛哈里发法伊兹（al-Fa‘iz）的维齐尔埃米尔萨利赫·塔拉伊（al-Salih Tala’i‘）建造。该建筑是建在商店单元之上的清真寺的早期例子，采用围绕古董柱拱廊的庭院形式。自建造以来，建筑周围的地面高度上升了两到三米；整个结构现在被一条人工沟渠包围，以便进入商店单元（其中一些仍在使用）。内部通过一个不寻常的龙骨拱门廊（委员会重建）进入，该门廊由古董柱支撑。门廊两侧的马什拉比耶屏风是原始马克苏拉（maqsura）屏风（现于伊斯兰博物馆）的复制品，青铜镀层门也是如此。北立面和南立面有两个次要入口。清真寺最重要的修复工作由委员会在1920年代和1930年代进行，当时该建筑从周围的增建结构中分离出来，大部分立面完全重建。原始拱廊是基布拉一侧的那些：侧面拱廊和西面（或入口）拱廊是委员会的重建作品，他们重建了清真寺的大部分以符合他们对法蒂玛清真寺应有样貌的设想。在此过程中，北拱廊的马穆鲁克替代品和一座马穆鲁克/奥斯曼宣礼塔被拆除。基布拉回廊的龙骨拱周围装饰有一条雕刻灰泥铭文带，并用雕刻木系梁相互连接。马穆鲁克米哈拉布的装饰几乎没有幸存。精美的带有几何装饰面板的木制敏巴尔（讲坛），由埃米尔巴克提穆尔·古坎达尔（Baktimur al-Gukandar）于公元1300年捐赠给清真寺，于1998年由EAP修复。此后，古物最高委员会（SCA）对整座建筑进行了另一次（极其繁重的）修复。",

It is a large, richly decorated courtyard mosque with two major portals to the north and west and a minor portal to the south. The original context of the western portal (which is decorated) is uncertain, since it no longer faces a significant street. Although the southern portal, in contrast, faces a street, it is plain. The decorated northern portal has fine marble work and two inscription bands. A further inscription band runs across the upper part of the mosque’s crenellated perimeter wall. The original minaret and wooden dome above the mihrab, supported on antique granite columns, are in good condition; the upper tier of the minaret and the dome are Comité replacements. The outer qibla arcade was entirely rebuilt by the Comité during extensive restorations from 1895 to 1903. The fountain pavilion in the center of the sahn was brought from the madrasa of Sultan Hasan (no. 133)—one of two originally in that madrasa—and installed at the same time (it has recently been totally reconstructed). Crenellations line the perimeter of the courtyard, which is flanked on the side of the qibla arcades by a magnificent inscribed turned-wood screen, and on the northern and southern sides by low marble balustrades. The wooden screen may have been built to screen off the qibla arcades from pedestrian traffic using the mosque as a shortcut between streets. The qibla wall has a fine marble dado and inlaid marble mihrab, adjacent to which is the original minbar. The foundation inscription is mounted on the northern wall within the qibla arcades. 这座清真寺由埃米尔阿勒通布加·马里达尼（Altunbugha al-Maridani，苏丹纳西尔·穆罕默德的斟酒官兼女婿）建造。这是一座装饰华丽的大型庭院清真寺，在北面和西面有两个主要入口，在南面有一个次要入口。西入口（有装饰）的原始环境不确定，因为它不再面向重要的街道。相比之下，虽然南入口面向街道，但它很朴素。装饰性的北入口有精美的大理石作品和两条铭文带。另一条铭文带沿着清真寺齿状围墙的上部延伸。原始的宣礼塔和米哈拉布上方的木制圆顶（由古董花岗岩柱支撑）状况良好；宣礼塔的上层和圆顶是委员会的替代品。外部基布拉拱廊在1895年至1903年的广泛修复中由委员会完全重建。庭院（sahn）中心的喷泉亭是从苏丹哈桑伊斯兰学校（编号133）搬来的——原为该伊斯兰学校中的两个之一——并同时安装在此（最近已完全重建）。庭院周边排列着城垛，基布拉拱廊一侧是一个宏伟的刻字车木屏风，南北两侧是低矮的大理石栏杆。木制屏风可能是为了将基布拉拱廊与使用清真寺作为街道间捷径的行人交通隔离开来而建造的。基布拉墙有一个精美的大理石护壁和镶嵌大理石米哈拉布，旁边是原始的敏巴尔。奠基铭文安装在基布拉拱廊内的北墙上。",

The complex he built on the Shari‘ Mu‘izz li-Din Allah includes a cruciform madrasa, minaret, sabil-kuttab, and tomb. Barsbay himself is buried in his funerary complex in the northern cemetery (monument no. 121), although various members of his family are interred here. The façade of the complex, covered in distinctive red-and-yellow ablaq masonry, has a continuous high-level inscription band and crenellation. The minaret has a square base with a muqarnas cornice, above which is set a circular second tier and mabkhara. The stone masonry dome, raised on scrolled corners over the tomb chamber, is carved with a chevron pattern. The portal, with a muqarnas hood and ablaq decoration, leads to a vestibule, which also gives access to the sabil. From here, a dog-legged corridor extends to the sahn, dominated by the qibla iwan, which contains an inlaid marble dado and mihrab and a Comité-period painted wood ceiling. The inlaid wood-and-ivory minbar is original. The western iwan retains its original ceiling; the high-level inscription band that runs around the sahn is unusual in providing details of the endowment that was made upon the madrasa. In 2002 a pair of remarkable interlinked circular-plan cisterns was discovered under the sabil of the complex, supported at their centers by monolithic granite columns (see SCA 2002). 巴尔斯贝（Barsbay）是苏丹穆阿亚德·谢赫的一名马穆鲁克，于公元1422年即位苏丹，并施行仁政直至1438年去世。他在穆伊兹·利丁·安拉街上的建筑群包括一所十字形伊斯兰学校、宣礼塔、萨比尔-库塔布和陵墓。巴尔斯贝本人葬于北部墓地的葬礼建筑群（古迹编号121），尽管他的许多家庭成员都葬于此。建筑群的立面覆盖着独特的红黄相间阿布拉格砌体，有一条连续的高处铭文带和城垛。宣礼塔从一个带有穆卡纳斯飞檐的方形基座升起，上方是圆形的第二层和香炉状顶部。墓室上方架在卷轴角落上的石砌圆顶刻有人字纹图案。带有穆卡纳斯罩和阿布拉格装饰的入口通向一个前厅，该前厅也通往萨比尔。从这里，一条折形走廊延伸至庭院（sahn），庭院由基布拉伊万主导，基布拉伊万包含一个镶嵌大理石护壁和米哈拉布以及一个委员会时期的彩绘木天花板。镶嵌木材和象牙的敏巴尔是原物。西伊万保留了原来的天花板；环绕庭院的高处铭文带不同寻常，提供了关于伊斯兰学校捐赠的详细信息。2002年，在建筑群萨比尔下方发现了一对非凡的相互连接的圆形蓄水池，中心由整块花岗岩柱支撑（见SCA 2002）。",

It later took the name of the qadi Sharaf al-Din, who converted the qa‘a into a mosque shortly after the construction of the palace was completed. The building’s context changed dramatically in the early twentieth century with the construction of Shari‘ al-Azhar, to which it is adjacent. The entrance to the mosque, set back from the road to the west (now out of use), is part of Sharaf al-Din’s work. This is a fine square-headed portal with ablaq and muqarnas, which seems more appropriate for the entrance to a palace than a mosque. The ground level adjacent to the building has risen by two meters, and the mosque is approached by descending a steep flight of stairs. There is a painted wood ceiling in the northern iwan, and a one-meter-wide wood inscription band survives on the northern side of the building. 这座清真寺是一个大型改建的卡阿（qa‘a），类似于塔什塔穆尔（no. 153）、沙基尔·伊本·加纳姆（no. 96）和艾哈迈德·贝伊·科希亚（no. 521）的那些，最初是穆希布·丁·叶海亚（Muhib al-Din Yayha）在公元1317年至1337年间建造的宫殿的一部分。它后来以卡迪·沙拉夫·丁（Qadi Sharaf al-Din）的名字命名，他在宫殿建成后不久将卡阿改建为清真寺。随着20世纪初相邻的爱资哈尔街的建设，该建筑的环境发生了巨大变化。清真寺的入口从西面的道路（现已停用）向后退缩，是沙拉夫·丁工程的一部分。这是一个带有阿布拉格和穆卡纳斯的精美方头入口，这似乎更适合宫殿入口而非清真寺。毗邻建筑的地面高度上升了两米，进入清真寺需要下一段陡峭的楼梯。北伊万有一个彩绘木天花板，建筑北侧保留了一条一米宽的木制铭文带。",

The wikala seems to be composed of two courtyards, whose peripheral arches can barely be discerned among later accretions, which are occupied by metal-working trades. The entrance to the wikala is directly opposite the wikalat al-Muhammadayn (no. 597); the character of the masonry suggests that the two buildings had the same patron. Hanna (1998) has posited that the two wikalas were built by the seventeenth-century merchant Isma‘il Abu Takiya and his partner ‘Abd al-Qadir al-Damiri, and she identifies the wikala attached to the sabil-kuttab al-Kirdani as the wikalat al-Kubra (‘the Larger’), and the wikalat al-Muhammadayn (no. 597) as the wikalat al-Sughra (‘the Smaller’). 此名录不仅包括萨比尔-库塔布本身，还包括与其相连的维卡拉（也称为阿布·塔基亚[Abu Takiya]维卡拉）的立面和入口。位于维卡拉北端的萨比尔已失去其库塔布，尽管它保留了一个大型装饰石门。维卡拉似乎由两个庭院组成，其周边的拱门在后来的加建结构中几乎难以辨认，目前被金属加工行业占用。维卡拉的入口正对着穆罕默德（al-Muhammadayn）维卡拉（编号597）；砖石工程的特征表明这两座建筑由同一赞助人建造。汉娜（Hanna，1998）认为这两个维卡拉是由17世纪商人伊斯梅尔·阿布·塔基亚及其合伙人阿卜杜勒·卡迪尔·达米里（‘Abd al-Qadir al-Damiri）建造的，她将附属于基尔达尼（al-Kirdani）萨比尔-库塔布的维卡拉认定为大维卡拉（wikalat al-Kubra），将穆罕默德维卡拉（编号597）认定为小维卡拉（wikalat al-Sughra）。",

The building was originally situated within an urban block beside the Khalig al-Masri, which ran its eastern side. The building was heavily restored by the Comité from 1884 to 1897, during which the entire southern façade and part of the northern façade were created, following the removal of adjacent structures. The western façade was later ‘embellished’ by the addition of a nineteenth-century sabil, moved from a nearby location (see U36).

The madrasa has lost most of the stone inscription that once ran along its walls; the minaret survives intact. 卡迪·叶海亚（Qadi Yahya）是一位文职埃米尔，后来成为苏丹贾克马克的总管。作为一个异常贪婪的税务官，他后来被苏丹盖特贝鞭打致死。叶海亚选择葬在这座清真寺里，这是他在开罗建造的三座清真寺之一（另见编号204）。该建筑最初位于哈里格·马斯里（Khalig al-Masri，开罗运河）旁的一个城市街区内，运河流经其东侧。该建筑在1884年至1897年间由委员会进行了大力修复，在此期间，随着相邻建筑的拆除，创建了整个南立面和部分北立面。西立面后来通过增加一个从附近位置移来的19世纪萨比尔（见U36）进行了“美化”。主入口通过北面一个刻有铭文的门，经折角通道进入一个有顶的四伊万伊斯兰学校。伊斯兰学校失去了曾经沿着墙壁延伸的大部分石刻铭文；宣礼塔完好无损。",

        "description": "This mosque was built in AD 1418 for a wazir of Sultan Farag ibn Barquq and al-Mu’ayyad Shaykh who was notorious for his harsh methods of tax collection. It is colloqially known as ‘the Mosque of the Girls’ (al-banat). The main portal faces onto Shari‘ Bur Sa‘id and has a sabil-kuttab to the south. A second, more modest entrance is from a dead-end alley off the Darb al-Gamamiz. The main portal leads through a bent corridor into a courtyard with four iwans. The ceilings of the qibla and western iwans are Comité-period decorated ceilings; the other two are original. The building was restored in the nineteenth century by Umm Husayn (see U36), who added the Ottoman-style minaret, and again most recently (in 2000) by the SCA. 这座清真寺建于公元1418年，是为苏丹法拉吉·伊本·巴尔库克和穆阿亚德·谢赫的一位维齐尔建造的，他因严酷的征税手段而臭名昭著。它通俗地被称为“女孩清真寺”（al-banat）。主入口面向赛义德港街，南面有一个萨比尔-库塔布。第二个较简朴的入口来自达尔布·加马米兹（Darb al-Gamamiz）旁的一条死胡同。主入口通过一条折形走廊通向一个有四个伊万的庭院。基布拉和西伊万的天花板是委员会时期的装饰天花板；另外两个是原物。该建筑于19世纪由乌姆·侯赛因（见U36）修复，她增加了奥斯曼风格的宣礼塔，最近一次（2000年）由古物最高委员会（SCA）修复。",

His complex was heavily restored by the Comité in the late nineteenth century, especially the sabil-kuttab. The wooden screen to the sabil and the mashrabiya on the kuttab all date from this restoration. The remainder of the façade, with a high-level inscription band and minaret, is intact. The interior of the mosque is spartan and modern, the only original fragment being a springing of the arch of the western iwan. 阿桑布加（Asanbugha，“强壮的公牛”，死于公元1375年）是苏丹纳西尔·穆罕默德的一位埃米尔；纳西尔死后他被监禁，但后来成为阿勒颇总督和军队总监。他的建筑群在19世纪后期由委员会进行了大力修复，特别是萨比尔-库塔布。萨比尔的木屏风和库塔布上的马什拉比耶都源于这次修复。立面的其余部分，包括高处的铭文带和宣礼塔，均完好无损。清真寺内部简朴且现代化，唯一的原始残片是西伊万拱门的起拱处。",

        "description": "This major complex, built by al-Zahir Barquq, the first Burgi Mamluk sultan of Egypt, includes a cruciform madrasa, a mausoleum, and a khanqah for 125 students. Barquq himself was re-interred in the northern cemetery in the khanqah built by his son Farag some years later (monument no. 149). The complex on the Bayn al-Qasrayn is a masterpiece of integrated design and decorative detailing. The crenellated façade has recessed window panels with muqarnas heads and a high-level inscription band. At the complex’s northern end stands the tomb chamber, the dome of which is a late nineteenth-century brick replacement for a plastered wood original that had collapsed. The minaret that rises adjacent to this is unusual in being heavily carved and patterned, the second tier bearing a motif of intersecting circles with inlaid marble. The portal has a semi-dome (supported by muqarnas pendentives), ablaq decoration, and a fine marble inscription. This leads through a groin-vaulted vestibule to a bent entrance that gives access to the sahn. The floors of the madrasa are paved with geometric patterns of colored marble. A fountain occupies the center of the sahn, with a wooden dome above it supported on marble columns, and an inscription band runs at high level above the pointed-arched iwans that define the space. On the qibla side, pairs of granite columns stand to either side of the central axis within the iwan, creating a tripartite space. An inlaid marble dado and mihrab, together with an elaborately decorated and gilded wooden ceiling, gives this iwan a particularly rich appearance. Liturgical furniture includes a fine minbar (a later endowment by Sultan Gaqmaq) and a wooden dikka. The tomb chamber matches the qibla iwan in the lavish use of marble decoration. To the west are located the students’ living units, which are largely ruined today and occupied by squatters. 这座主要建筑群由埃及第一位布尔吉（Burgi）马穆鲁克苏丹扎希尔·巴尔库克（al-Zahir Barquq）建造，包括一所十字形伊斯兰学校、一座陵墓和一所供125名学生使用的汗卡（khanqah）。巴尔库克本人后来被重新安葬在北部墓地，即其子法拉吉（Farag）数年后建造的汗卡中（古迹编号149）。位于拜因·盖斯林（Bayn al-Qasrayn）的这座建筑群是综合设计和装饰细节的杰作。带有城垛的立面拥有凹进的窗板，配有穆卡纳斯顶部和高处的铭文带。在建筑群的北端矗立着墓室，其圆顶是19世纪后期的砖制替代品，原为已坍塌的灰泥木结构。紧邻其升起的宣礼塔不同寻常，雕刻和图案繁复，第二层带有镶嵌大理石的相交圆图案。入口有一个半圆顶（由穆卡纳斯帆拱支撑）、阿布拉格装饰和精美的大理石铭文。这通过一个交叉拱顶的前厅通向一个折角入口，从而进入庭院（sahn）。伊斯兰学校的地板铺有彩色大理石的几何图案。庭院中心有一个喷泉，上方有由大理石柱支撑的木制圆顶，一条铭文带在界定空间的尖拱伊万上方高处延伸。在基布拉一侧，成对的花岗岩柱矗立在伊万内中轴线的两侧，形成一个三部分的空间。镶嵌大理石护壁和米哈拉布，连同装饰精美且镀金的木制天花板，赋予了这个伊万特别丰富的外观。礼拜家具包括一个精美的敏巴尔（后来由苏丹贾克马克捐赠）和一个木制迪卡（dikka，诵经台）。墓室在大理石装饰的奢华使用上与基布拉伊万相匹配。西面是学生的居住单元，如今大部分已成废墟并被擅自占地者占据。",

This foundation of Sultan al-Ghuri constitutes one half of an architectural ensemble that straddles the Qasaba: the counterpart structure, on the eastern side of the street, includes his mausoleum and a sabil-kuttab (see no. 67 above). The interior of the mosque follows a cruciform plan, with the iwans fronted by large pointed arches. The decorative treatment of all surfaces is lavish: particularly noteworthy is the deep muqarnas band that runs along the top of the sahn. A cycle of restoration at the mosque, undertaken by the SCA, was completed in 2000. The house to the north of the madrasa included in this listing was substantially demolished by the creation of Shari‘ al-Azhar; what remains is disfigured by modern shop fronts. 这是一所十字形伊斯兰学校，建在极其密集的商铺单元和内部街道之上。它拥有一座不同寻常的三层方形宣礼塔和一个装饰精美的阿布拉格入口。一条铭文带在窗户凹处上方的高处延伸。建筑的上层包含供苏菲派学生居住的小室。苏丹古里的这个地基构成了跨越卡萨巴（Qasaba，主干道）的建筑群的一半：街道东侧的对应结构包括他的陵墓和萨比尔-库塔布（见上文编号67）。清真寺的内部遵循十字形平面，伊万前面有巨大的尖拱。所有表面的装饰处理都非常奢华：特别值得注意的是沿着庭院顶部延伸的深穆卡纳斯带。古物最高委员会（SCA）对清真寺的一轮修复工作于2000年完成。此名录中伊斯兰学校北面的房屋因爱资哈尔街的修建而被大幅拆除；剩下的部分被现代店面破坏了外观。",

        "description": "Sultan al-Mu’ayyad Shaykh built this mosque in fulfillment of a vow he made while incarcerated in the notorious prison that previously occupied the site. This is an enormous courtyard mosque, elevated above shops, with the main doors taken from the madrasa of Sultan Hasan (no. 133). The walls at the north, south, and west were rebuilt by the Ministry of Endowments in 1874. The towering portal, with ablaq masonry, granite door jambs, and inlaid inscriptions, stands on the eastern side of the building. Of the three minarets originally constructed for the mosque, only the two on top of the Bab Zuwayla (no. 199) survive, inscribed with the name of their architect. The original route into the mosque was probably from the vestibule through the northern corridor, but visitors proceed today directly to the qibla arcades from a door on the southern side of the vestibule through the domed tomb chamber of the sultan. The outermost arcade was rebuilt in 1874 after its collapse and is distinguished by its plain ceiling, unlikes the heavily painted ceilings of the other original arcades. An original inscribed marble dikka stands in the center of the outermost original arcade. The qibla wall and mihrab are magnificent examples of inlaid marble technique. Some Ottoman tiles also survive at the southern end of this wall at high level. The inlaid and carved woodwork on the original minbar and doors to the tomb chambers is of a similarly high standard. The dome over the southern tomb chamber, intended for the female members of the sultan’s family, may never have been completed, and this space now has a flat timber roof. A staircase constructed by the Comité outside the southeastern corner of the mosque leads up to the platform of the Bab Zuwayla. The mosque’s twin minarets (their finials are Comité restorations) stand atop the two flanking towers of the Fatimid gate, with their supporting structure passing through the lower level of the towers. The courtyard of the mosque contains a domed ablution fountain; this is not an original feature, as the area would have been simply paved in Mamluk times. To the west of the courtyard is the complex’s bathhouse (no. 410). A major project to restore the mosque and rebuild the southern, northern and western arcades was initiated in 2000. During the course of this work, excavations revealed the foundation of the Fatimid city wall within the mosque (indicated on the map sheet in dashed lines). This has subsequently been covered over. 苏丹穆阿亚德·谢赫为了履行他在之前占据该地点的臭名昭著的监狱中被囚禁时许下的誓言而建造了这座清真寺。这是一座巨大的庭院清真寺，高架在商店之上，大门取自苏丹哈桑的伊斯兰学校（编号133）。北、南、西面的墙壁由宗教基金部于1874年重建。高耸的入口位于建筑东侧，拥有阿布拉格砌体、花岗岩门框和镶嵌铭文。在最初为清真寺建造的三座宣礼塔中，只有祖韦拉门（Bab Zuwayla，编号199）顶部的两座幸存下来，上面刻有建筑师的名字。进入清真寺的原始路线可能是从前厅通过北走廊，但今天的游客是从前厅南侧的一扇门直接穿过苏丹的圆顶墓室进入基布拉拱廊。最外面的拱廊在倒塌后于1874年重建，其特点是朴素的天花板，不同于其他原始拱廊色彩浓重的彩绘天花板。一个原始的刻字大理石迪卡（dikka）矗立在最外层原始拱廊的中心。基布拉墙和米哈拉布是镶嵌大理石工艺的宏伟典范。一些奥斯曼瓷砖也幸存在这面墙南端的高处。原始敏巴尔和墓室门上的镶嵌及雕刻木制品也具有同样高的水准。南墓室上方的圆顶原打算供苏丹家族女性成员使用，可能从未完工，该空间现在有一个平坦的木屋顶。委员会在清真寺东南角外建造了一个楼梯，通向祖韦拉门的平台。清真寺的双宣礼塔（其尖顶是委员会修复的）矗立法蒂玛城门两侧的塔楼之上，其支撑结构穿过塔楼的下层。清真寺的庭院包含一个圆顶沐浴喷泉；这不是原始特征，因为该区域在马穆鲁克时期应该只是铺砌的。庭院西面是建筑群的澡堂（编号410）。一项修复清真寺并重建南部、北部和西部拱廊的重大项目于2000年启动。在工程过程中，挖掘工作揭示了清真寺内的法蒂玛城墙地基（在地图页上以虚线标示）。这随后被覆盖了。",

The most complete description of its architecture can be found in Creswell (1952). It comprises two large round-fronted towers that are surmounted by the twin minarets of the mosque of al-Mu’ayyad Shaykh (no. 190). The current access to the upper and lower platforms of the gate is from a staircase to the west of the gate, and is a construction of the Comité. The original access, now blocked, lies to the east of the gate, and was within the thickness of the curtain wall, which can be seen from the upper platform. The gate was heavily restored by the Comité, and it was cleaned and restored from 1999 to 2003 (together with the minarets of al-Mu’ayyad Shaykh) by the EAP. Recent excavations have revealed the level of the Fatimid pavement below the gate’s entrance to be some three meters below ground level. 祖韦拉门（Bab Zuwayla）标志着巴德尔·贾马利建造的卡希拉围墙的南界。对其建筑最完整的描述可以在克莱斯韦尔（Creswell，1952）的著作中找到。它由两座巨大的圆形正面塔楼组成，塔楼顶部是穆阿亚德·谢赫清真寺（编号190）的双宣礼塔。目前通往城门上下平台的通道来自城门西侧的一个楼梯，这是委员会建造的。原来的通道现已被封堵，位于城门东侧，在幕墙的厚度内，从上层平台可以看到。该城门曾由委员会进行过大力修复，并于1999年至2003年由EAP（连同穆阿亚德·谢赫的宣礼塔一起）进行了清洁和修复。最近的挖掘显示，城门入口下方的法蒂玛路面高度在地面以下约三米处。",

Safiya managed to appropriate all of ‘Uthman’s property after his death. The mosque is raised high off the ground and is approached by large semicircular stairs on three sides. These entrances lead to a columned forecourt, with domes around its perimeter, that precedes a domed prayer hall. The mihrab is lined with a Mamluk-style marble revetment, and the minbar is constructed of marble. A wooden gallery sits above the western entrance wall; another runs along the base of the dome. The subsidiary dome to the northeast does not seem to cover a tomb as one might expect. The minaret is intact, although the mosque has lost the garden that once surrounded it (see no. 330). 这座清真寺由马利卡·萨菲亚（Malika Safiya，即索菲亚，苏丹穆拉德三世的威尼斯妻子，穆罕默德三世的母亲）的首席黑人太监乌斯曼·阿迦（‘Uthman Agha）建造。萨菲亚在乌斯曼死后设法侵吞了他的所有财产。清真寺高出地面，通过三面的大型半圆形楼梯进入。这些入口通向一个圆柱前院，周边有圆顶，前院通向圆顶祈祷大厅。米哈拉布内衬马穆鲁克风格的大理石饰面，敏巴尔由大理石建造。西入口墙上方有一个木制回廊；另一个沿着圆顶底部延伸。东北面的附属圆顶似乎并不像人们预期的那样覆盖着墓地。宣礼塔完好无损，尽管清真寺已经失去了曾经环绕它的花园（见编号330）。",

Parts of this complex may have been used during the pilgrimage procession. The entire palace, which includes two ruined qa‘as, was at one point part of the same listing, now applied solely to the maq‘ad. This has three arches supported on marble columns with a small wooden pedimented baldachino between two of the columns. The maq‘ad and the upper floors (heavily restored by the Comité) are approached from a trilobed portal.

        "dating": "AH 263–65 / AD 876–79",
        "description": "The mosque of Ibn Tulun—the oldest and largest extant mosque within the area of Historic Cairo—follows a model imported from Samarra: a courtyard with arcades around it resting on brick piers, which is surrounded by a ziyada, or additional walled space, on all sides except that of the qibla. The many gates within this outer wall originally led to streets outside the perimeter of the building. The whole mosque is built on a rocky outcrop called the Gebel Yashkur. The outer wall of the ziyada and the outer wall of the mosque itself are topped by a plastered-brick crenellation of a unique interlocking design. The level of the mosque is raised slightly above that of the ziyada, which contains another remarkable feature on the northern side: a stone minaret with an external staircase. The western side of the ziyada contains a sabil built by Sultan Qaytbay (see U119). The minaret is certainly of later date; at least part of it was constructed in AD 1297 by Sultan Lagin, who also commissioned the stone fountain pavilion with a dome in the center of the courtyard of the mosque. (The exact dating of the minaret remains a subject of controversy among architectural historians.) It is possible that the spiral form of the minaret’s upper section was derived from the mosque’s original minaret, which may have followed a Samarran spiral prototype. It is the only minaret in Cairo with a staircase situated on the outside of its shaft. On the qibla side of the mosque, half of the original foundation inscription is mounted on a pier. Two other piers contain flat stucco mihrabs: one is a Fatimid example (commissioned by the vizier al-Afdal) and the other an archaizing Mamluk example (by Lagin). Another flat stucco mihrab, dating to the thirteenth century, is located on the qibla wall to the left of the central mihrab. A dikka on marble columns in front of the mihrab is a later addition by Lagin, who also commissioned the mosque’s fine minbar. Much of the mosque’s ceiling has been replaced, but fragments of a wooden inscription band in kufic that ran across the top of the qibla arcades can still be seen. Sections of the original stamped and carved stucco patterns adorning the soffits of the arches of the arcades are also visible. The outer wall of the mosque is pierced at high level by more than a hundred windows with stucco grilles, each of which has its individual geometric design. The major restoration works undertaken in the mosque by the Comité during the early part of the twentieth century included the rebuilding of the fallen outer arcade on the qibla side of the courtyard, the restoration of the fountain, the unblocking of all the arches, the demolition of buildings encroaching onto the ziyada, the replacement of the roofs, the landscaping of the courtyard/ziyada/surrounds, and the demolition of a Mamluk minaret in the southeastern corner of the building. Another (heavily criticized for its use of concrete in the courtyard and steel reinforcement in the walls) restoration of the mosque by the SCA commenced in 2000 and is drawing to a close in 2004. 伊本·图伦清真寺（Mosque of Ibn Tulun）是开罗历史城区现存最古老、最大的清真寺，遵循从萨迈拉（Samarra）引进的模式：庭院四周是有砖墩支撑的拱廊，除基布拉一侧外，四周被ziyada（外苑或附加围墙空间）环绕。外墙内的许多大门最初通往建筑周边的街道。整座清真寺建在一个名为亚什库尔山（Gebel Yashkur）的岩石露头上。外苑的外墙和清真寺本身的外墙顶部都有独特连锁设计的灰泥砖城垛。清真寺的高度略高于外苑，外苑北侧包含另一个显著特征：一座带有外部楼梯的石制宣礼塔。外苑西侧有一个由苏丹盖特贝建造的萨比尔（见U119）。宣礼塔肯定是后来的作品；至少部分是由苏丹拉金（Sultan Lagin）于公元1297年建造的，他还委托建造了清真寺庭院中心的带圆顶的石制喷泉亭。（宣礼塔的确切年代仍是建筑历史学家争论的主题。）宣礼塔上部的螺旋形式可能源自清真寺的原始宣礼塔，后者可能遵循了萨迈拉的螺旋原型。它是开罗唯一一座楼梯位于塔身外部的宣礼塔。在清真寺的基布拉一侧，一半的原始奠基铭文安装在一个墩柱上。另外两个墩柱包含平面灰泥米哈拉布：一个是法蒂玛时期的例子（由维齐尔阿夫达尔委托），另一个是仿古的马穆鲁克例子（由拉金委托）。另一个可追溯到13世纪的平面灰泥米哈拉布位于中央米哈拉布左侧的基布拉墙上。米哈拉布前大理石柱上的迪卡（dikka）是拉金后来添加的，他还委托制作了清真寺精美的敏巴尔。清真寺的大部分天花板已被更换，但仍能看到横跨基布拉拱廊顶部的库法体木制铭文带的碎片。装饰拱廊拱腹的原始压印和雕刻灰泥图案的部分也清晰可见。清真寺的外墙在高处开有百余扇窗户，带有灰泥格栅，每扇都有独特的几何设计。委员会在20世纪初对清真寺进行的重大修复工作包括重建庭院基布拉一侧倒塌的外部拱廊、修复喷泉、疏通所有拱门、拆除侵占外苑的建筑、更换屋顶、庭院/外苑/周边的景观美化，以及拆除建筑东南角的一座马穆鲁克宣礼塔。古物最高委员会（SCA）于2000年开始对清真寺进行另一项修复（因在庭院中使用混凝土和在墙壁中使用钢筋加固而受到严厉批评），该工程于2004年接近尾声。",

(It has also been commonLy given the name of the other sabil: Muhammad Katkhuda Mustahfizan.) Part of the confusion about the identity of the founder may stem from changes in ownership and multiple inscriptions (see Raymond [2000]). The sabil has an unusual form in that its façades are obliquely aligned to the street, which curves at this point. The ground level has risen here to the level of the sabil grilles, which are of bronze and contain some surviving inserts with the name of Allah. There is a marble inscription in Turkish over one grille and tiled lunettes over both. The interior, which contains an original marble salsabil, was once lined in blue-and-white tiles, many of which have gone missing. The water distribution room has a further inscription in Arabic around the ceiling. The waqf of Yusuf Agha also included a wikala to the northwest of the sabil (U39). 这座古迹位于米赫曼达尔清真寺（编号115）以西的达尔布·艾哈迈尔（Darb al Ahmar）拐角处，未在1:5000穆罕默德古迹地图上标记，并在古迹索引中与另一个萨比尔（编号150）混淆。（它也常被赋予另一个萨比尔的名字：穆罕默德·卡特胡达·穆斯塔菲赞。）关于创建者身份的部分混淆可能源于所有权变更和多重铭文（见Raymond [2000]）。该萨比尔的形式不同寻常，因为它的立面与街道倾斜排列，街道在此处弯曲。这里的地面高度已上升至萨比尔格栅的水平，格栅是青铜的，包含一些幸存的刻有真主之名的插件。一个格栅上方有土耳其语的大理石铭文，两个格栅上方都有瓷砖半月窗。内部包含一个原始的大理石萨尔萨比尔，曾经内衬蓝白瓷砖，其中许多已经丢失。配水室天花板周围还有阿拉伯语铭文。优素福·阿迦的瓦克夫还包括萨比尔西北方的一个维卡拉（U39）。",

Both houses have significant remnants of Mamluk building: a doorway bearing the cartouches of Sultan Qaytbay, and dating to ca. AD 1480, stands in the eastern courtyard, while an enormous qa‘a stands at ground level off the western courtyard. There is a fine Ottoman qa‘a at second-floor level overlooking the Shari‘ al-Tabbana, with painted wood ceilings and elaborate mashrabiyas. The only surviving maq‘ad is in the western courtyard, to the north of the (partially collapsed) groin-vaulted stone entrance onto the Suq al-Silah, which seems to have become the principal entrance to the combined residences. The entire property came into the hands of Ahmad Katkhuda al-Razzaz in the late eighteenth century, and it was no doubt modified to suit the needs of its new owners. Perhaps the two courtyards were linked during this period. The site is currently undergoing selective conservation by the EAP and the SCA. 这座庞大的三层宫殿——最初是被小巷隔开的两座独立住宅——围绕两个庭院建造，从巴布·瓦齐尔街（在此处称为al-Tabbana）延伸到苏克·西拉（Suq al-Silah，武器市场），在这两条干道上都有入口。两座房子都有重要的马穆鲁克建筑遗迹：东庭院中矗立着一个带有苏丹盖特贝椭圆徽章的门口，可追溯至约公元1480年，而西庭院旁的一层则有一个巨大的卡阿。二楼有一个俯瞰Tabbana街的精美奥斯曼卡阿，配有彩绘木天花板和精致的马什拉比耶。唯一幸存的马卡德位于西庭院，在通往苏克·西拉的（部分倒塌的）交叉拱顶石入口的北面，该入口似乎已成为合并后住宅的主入口。整个房产在18世纪后期落入艾哈迈德·卡特胡达·拉扎兹（Ahmad Katkhuda al-Razzaz）手中，毫无疑问，为了适应新主人的需求，它被进行了修改。也许两个庭院就是在此期间连接起来的。该地点目前正由EAP和古物最高委员会（SCA）进行选择性保护。",

It was built for Sultan Mahmud by the black eunuch Bashir Agha, who had already built his own foundation (the sabil-kuttab, no. 309) opposite. The crenellated façades of the building have two continuous decorative bands of arabesques running around them, and there are three portals. The main portal, which leads into a domed vestibule with stairs leading up to the raised courtyard, is a pointed arch with cushioned voussoirs, decorative strapwork framing, tiled inlay panels, flanking marble columns, and marble inscriptions. The portal leading to the sabil, also on the west elevation, is of simpler design, with surrounding strapwork and decorative banding. The third portal, located on the south elevation, gives access to a staircase leading to the kuttab and is flanked by marble columns, over which stands a pointed arch with a decorative strapwork and banded frame. The courtyard has a central baldachin on four columns at its center, and is surrounded by an arcade of columns that relates to an outer ring of cell units with shallow pendentive domes. There is a small zawiya on the north side. The interior of the building is now occupied by the offices of the main inspectorate of the SCA’s Coptic and Islamic Section (South Sector). The sabil’s interior with blue-and-white Iznik-style tiles has an inlaid-marble floor and decorative painted wood ceiling. The windows to the sabil have been half bricked-up, but two of their fine floral-style bronze grilles are intact. The arcade around the kuttab above has been enclosed with a modern glazed screen with stained-glass stucco grille overpanels, but the double eaves (the upper of which is scalloped) following the curved plan of the sabil, are unaltered. 该建筑的布局——建在商店上方的抬高的拱廊庭院——类似于早得多的苏莱曼帕夏塔基亚（编号225）。然而，与其前身不同的是，它的南端增加了一个弓形前部的萨比尔-库塔布。它是黑人太监巴希尔·阿迦（Bashir Agha）为苏丹马哈茂德建造的，巴希尔·阿迦已经在对面建立了自己的地基（萨比尔-库塔布，编号309）。该建筑的齿状立面有两条连续的蔓藤花纹装饰带环绕，共有三个入口。主入口通向一个圆顶前厅，有楼梯通往抬高的庭院，是一个带有垫状拱石的尖拱，配有装饰性带状纹饰框架、瓷砖镶嵌面板、侧翼大理石柱和大理石铭文。通往萨比尔的入口也位于西立面，设计较为简单，周围有带状纹饰和装饰带。第三个入口位于南立面，通向通往库塔布的楼梯，两侧有大理石柱，上方是一个带有装饰性带状纹饰和带状框架的尖拱。庭院中心有一个由四根柱子支撑的中央华盖，周围环绕着柱廊，与外圈带有浅帆拱圆顶的小室单元相连。北侧有一个小扎维亚。该建筑内部现被古物最高委员会（SCA）科普特和伊斯兰部门（南部）的主要监察办公室占用。萨比尔内部饰有蓝白伊兹尼克风格瓷砖，拥有镶嵌大理石地板和装饰性彩绘木天花板。萨比尔的窗户已被半砖封堵，但其中两个精美的花卉风格青铜格栅完好无损。上方库塔布周围的拱廊已被带有彩色玻璃灰泥格栅顶板的现代玻璃屏风封闭，但跟随萨比尔弯曲平面的双重屋檐（上层为扇贝形）未变。",

Its designation as ‘khanqah’ is not justified by what remains of the original construction, which is essentially a tomb or zawiya. The current entrance to the building (from the west) is not original. The principal façade and portal are on the east; the latter is inscribed and decorated with marble. Part of this inscription and decoration appears to have been recently stolen. One lintel on a window in the façade is also inscribed. A Comité-style kuttab projection in timber to the south side of the portal has been glazed to make an office. The interior of the zawiya/tomb has the remains of a fine inlaid marble qibla wall and mihrab. There is a long and partly damaged inscription on the walls at high level, and a pair of geometric inlaid marble kufic panels below this. The floor and ceiling are modern, perhaps dating to 1910, when the building was remodeled by the Comité. 该建筑也被称为萨阿德·丁·易卜拉欣·阿拉比（Sa‘ad al-Din Ibrahim al-Arabi）扎维亚，今天被古物最高委员会（SCA）的办公室占用。其作为“汗卡”的称谓并不符合原始建筑的遗存，因为其实质上是一座陵墓或扎维亚。目前的入口（来自西面）不是原物。主要立面和入口在东面；后者刻有铭文并饰有大理石。部分铭文和装饰似乎最近被盗。立面上一扇窗户的门楣也刻有铭文。入口南侧的一个委员会风格的木制库塔布突出部分已被装上玻璃，改成办公室。扎维亚/陵墓的内部有精美的镶嵌大理石基布拉墙和米哈拉布的遗迹。墙壁高处有一长段部分受损的铭文，下面是一对几何镶嵌大理石库法体面板。地板和天花板是现代的，可能追溯到1910年，当时该建筑由委员会进行了改造。",

The simple trilobed portal, approached by a steep flight of steps and flanked by a drinking spout with an inscribed marble dedication dated AH 1258 (AD 1842), has two inscription bands. Much of the façade to the west has collapsed. The separate stone domed tomb chamber in the center of the courtyard is lined internally and faced externally with eighteenth-century blue and-white Iznik-style tiles. 这座建筑是开罗的第一座塔基亚（takiya），由哈尔瓦蒂（Khalawati）托钵僧教团的一位多彩谢赫建立，他于公元1534年去世，享年一百多岁。周边的庭院结构和立面大部分似乎后来经过了改造，只留下创建者的陵墓作为唯一的原始元素。简单的三叶形入口通过一段陡峭的台阶到达，侧翼有一个饮水口，上面有刻于伊斯兰历1258年（公元1842年）的大理石献词，入口有两条铭文带。西面的大部分立面已经倒塌。庭院中心的独立石制圆顶墓室内部内衬，外部贴面均为18世纪的蓝白伊兹尼克风格瓷砖。",

It is unusual among Cairene houses not only for its size, but also for the preservation of some ancillary service elements such as a waterwheel and corn mill in a garden behind the house. The garden also contains the reconstructed late-Mamluk tomb of Gamal al-Din, with an unusual pierced dome, moved to this location in 1952. Maury (1983) suggests that this house, together with the house of Mustafa Gaf‘ar (no. 471), and the Khorazati house (U3), may at one time have been parts of a single huge dependency. The house has several large qa‘as, a maq‘ad, and a fine bathhouse. It was heavily restored by the Comité in the 1930s and further restored in 1998–2000. 这座庭院住宅在17世纪最初属于谢赫·塔布拉维（Shaykh al-Tablawi），后来转入谢赫·西海米（Shaykh al-Sihaymi）及其继承人手中；委员会称其为卡萨比（al-Kassabi）住宅。在开罗的房屋中，它不仅因其规模而不寻常，还因其房屋后面花园中保存了一些附属服务元素，如水车和谷物磨。花园还包含重建的马穆鲁克晚期贾马尔·丁（Gamal al-Din）陵墓，该陵墓有一个不寻常的穿孔圆顶，于1952年移至此地。Maury（1983）认为，这座房子连同穆斯塔法·加法尔住宅（编号471）和霍拉扎蒂住宅（U3），可能曾是同一个巨大庄园的一部分。房子有几个大卡阿、一个马卡德和一个精美的澡堂。它于1930年代由委员会大力修复，并于1998-2000年进一步修复。",

It is also used for a small part of the wall appearing on map sheet 25 (below). Attached to the section of the wall running between the Bab al-Futuh and the Bab al-Nasr are three large square-fronted towers that are built of ashlar masonry over a rubble core, with columns set into them horizontally to provide reinforcement. The portion of the wall to the west of the Bab al-Futuh includes a square stone tower containing a staircase and a vast chamber with several reused pharaonic stone fragments, and another round-fronted tower. It was the wall that was the object of Creswell’s interest when he achieved, through the agency of the Comité in the 1940s, his aim of urban clearance outside the wall with a view to revealing its true appearance. This process included the demolition of the mosque of ‘Ayesha al-Sutuhiya (no. 558). The listing ‘352’ is applied today to all the city walls of Cairo indiscriminately whether of Fatimid of Ayyubid date, but this map reverts to the distinction found in the 1924 Map of Mohammedan Monuments of Cairo: no. 307 for Ayyubid walls and no. 352 for Fatimid walls. This small fragment of wall marks the line of the enceinte of Badr al-Gamali leading to the Bab al Qantara (U8). Heavily restored by the Comité, it is included for reference with the same registration number as the Fatimid walls between the Bab al-Nasr and the Bab al-Futuh. On this map sheet, the northwestern corner of the first mud-brick Fatimid enclosure wall of the city, built by Gawhar al-Siqilli, is clearly expressed in the surviving urban fabric, following the street to the north of Shari‘ Amir al Guyush and returning at a right angle heading south. 此名录在此用于涵盖纳斯尔门（Bab al-Nasr）和福图门（Bab al-Futuh）之间的法蒂玛城墙，该城墙也向西延伸了一段距离，然后与阿尤布城墙相连（见编号307）。它也用于出现在地图页25的一小部分墙体（见下文）。连接福图门和纳斯尔门之间城墙段的是三座大型方形正面塔楼，由方石砌体覆盖在碎石核心上建成，柱子水平嵌入其中以提供加固。福图门以西的城墙部分包括一座方形石塔（包含楼梯和带有几块重新利用的法老石碎片的巨大房间）和另一座圆形正面塔楼。正是这堵墙引起了克莱斯韦尔的兴趣，他在1940年代通过委员会实现了清理墙外城市区域的目标，以揭示其真实面貌。这一过程包括拆除阿伊莎·苏图希亚（‘Ayesha al-Sutuhiya）清真寺（编号558）。今天，“352”号名录不加区分地适用于开罗所有的城墙，无论是法蒂玛时期还是阿尤布时期，但本图恢复了1924年开罗穆罕默德古迹地图中的区别：编号307代表阿尤布城墙，编号352代表法蒂玛城墙。这一小段墙体标志着通往坎塔拉门（U8）的巴德尔·贾马利防御圈的线路。经委员会大力修复，它以与纳斯尔门和福图门之间的法蒂玛城墙相同的登记号列入参考。在这张地图页上，由乔哈尔·西奇利建造的城市第一道泥砖法蒂玛围墙的西北角在幸存的城市肌理中清晰可见，沿着阿米尔·古尤什街（Shari‘ Amir al Guyush）以北的街道延伸，并成直角向南折回。",

        "description": "This structure is all that remains of an early palace, rebuilt in the Ottoman period. The precise dating of the building has been a matter of dispute (summarized in O’Kane 2000). It has two iwans that are, unusually, enclosed by tunnel vaults of plastered brick rather than flat timber ceilings. The central lantern has collapsed. The walls are made of stone; remains of a wooden inscription band survive around the perimeter of the room. The plan represented on map sheet 13 is archival, as many of the outlying sections of the palace have now disintegrated. The qa‘a derives its name from the shaykh who is buried nearby (see U29) and was registered in 1927. In 2000 it was occupied by a carpenter’s workshop. 该结构是一座早期宫殿的仅存部分，曾在奥斯曼时期重建。该建筑的确切年代一直存在争议（总结于O’Kane 2000）。它有两个伊万，不寻常的是，它们由灰泥砖的筒形拱顶封闭，而不是平坦的木材天花板。中央灯笼天窗已坍塌。墙壁由石头制成；房间周边残留着木制铭文带。地图页13上显示的平面图是档案资料，因为宫殿的许多外围部分现在已经瓦解。这个卡阿（qa‘a）的名字源于葬在附近的谢赫（见U29），并于1927年登记。2000年时，它被一个木工车间占用。",

Salah al-Din chose the site for the first khanqah in Egypt, and it became a major center for Sufism, known as the Salahiya. The present structure appears to date to the nineteenth century, perhaps incorporating traces of earlier buildings. The mosque has an unusual plan, with four covered prayer halls arranged around an open courtyard, accessed by a dog-legged corridor. Of the three surviving halls, that to the south has arcades with marble columns, while those to the east and west have stone piers and arches. The collapsed northern section may have had columns to match its southern counterpart. The bathhouse attached to the mosque is commonly called the hammam al Gamaliya (U4). 这座清真寺建在一座法蒂玛宫殿的遗址上，该宫殿由哈里发穆斯坦绥尔的获释奴隶赛义德（Sa‘id）于公元11世纪后期建立。萨拉赫·丁（Salah al-Din）选择了这个地点作为埃及的第一座汗卡（khanqah），它成为了一个主要的苏菲主义中心，被称为萨拉希亚（Salahiya）。目前的结构似乎可以追溯到19世纪，可能融合了早期建筑的痕迹。清真寺的布局不同寻常，有四个有顶的祈祷大厅围绕着一个开放的庭院，通过一条折形走廊进入。在幸存的三个大厅中，南面的大厅有带大理石柱的拱廊，而东面和西面的大厅则有石墩和拱门。已倒塌的北段可能曾拥有与其南部对应部分相匹配的柱子。附属于清真寺的澡堂通常被称为盖马利亚澡堂（hammam al Gamaliya，U4）。",

From the fourteenth century until 1660, it served as the seat of the Coptic patriarchate. The church is located some four meters below present ground level, which is further evidence for the antiquity of the foundation. The plan of the church is basilical, with a narthex and three sanctuaries. The nave is lined with antique columns, and the roof above it has a wooden barrel vault. The major problem affecting the church is water: it is below the water table, and constant pumping is required to avoid flooding. 这个古老的建筑群包括圣母玛利亚教堂及其附属修道院、圣梅尔库里乌斯（St. Mercurius）教堂和圣乔治教堂。前者是这些结构中最古老的，其地基可能追溯到公元10世纪；然而，大多数可见的结构是18世纪的。从14世纪直到1660年，它一直是科普特教皇的驻地。教堂位于目前地面以下约四米处，这是其地基古老的进一步证据。教堂的平面是巴西利卡式的，有一个前廊和三个圣所。中殿排列着古董柱，上方的屋顶有木制筒形拱顶。影响教堂的主要问题是水：它位于地下水位以下，需要不断抽水以避免淹水。",

Only the men’s half of the bath house survives, its entrance located on the Sukkariya. This was in use until recently, and it conforms to the standard model of Cairene bathhouse, with a disrobing room and central domed space, off of which lie the smaller domed tank rooms. The women’s section was accessed from the small alley (known as the ‘Atfat al-Hammam) running to the north of the wikala of Nafisa al-Bayda. 自公元12世纪以来，一座以卡迪·法迪尔（Qadi al-Fadil）名义建立的男女双重澡堂就一直矗立在这个地点。目前的结构可能是后来的重建。该澡堂曾一度属于卡拉温的瓦克夫；18世纪后期，它落入拥有相邻维卡拉（编号395）的纳菲萨·拜达手中。只有澡堂的男性一半幸存下来，其入口位于Sukkariya。这直到最近仍在使用，符合开罗澡堂的标准模式，有一个更衣室和中央圆顶空间，旁边是较小的圆顶水箱房。女性区域是从纳菲萨·拜达维卡拉北面的一条小巷（称为‘Atfat al-Hammam）进入的。",

More likely is the attribution by Hanna (1998) that the wikala was one of a pair built in the seventeenth century by the merchant Isma‘il Abu Takiya and his partner (see no. 179). The Comité first assigned this wikala the number 500, which had already been given to the façade of the house of al-Kashif; it was subse quently given a new registration number. 该建筑的立面、入口和入口通道在1933年至1935年间被分类。维卡拉的内部目前被煤冶炼厂和金属加工行业占用，已基本被毁。Raymond和Wiet（1979）认为这可能是《埃及记述》中提到的作为金匠维卡拉的wikalat al-Khatib。更可能是Hanna（1998）的归属，即该维卡拉是商人Isma‘il Abu Takiya及其合伙人在17世纪建造的一对维卡拉之一（见编号179）。委员会最初将该维卡拉分配为500号，该编号已被给予al-Kashif房屋的立面；随后它被给予了一个新的登记号。",

Although the upper floors of the building have been destroyed, and a large modern apartment block has been built on the southwestern corner of the block, the form of the interior court yard bounded by stone arches (a perfect square) is still visible. The report of the Comité refers to a zawiya (no longer extant) in the middle of the courtyard. Pauty (1936) ascribed the number 501 to this building (another instance of ‘double-listing’). 这座维卡拉由Murtada Agha ibn Muhammad建造，于1951年后被取消登记。尽管该建筑的上层已被摧毁，并且在街区的西南角建造了一座大型现代公寓楼，但由石拱围成的内部庭院形式（一个完美的正方形）仍然可见。委员会的报告提到庭院中间有一个扎维亚（已不复存在）。Pauty（1936）将编号501归于此建筑（另一个“双重列表”的例子）。",

Despite number accre tions, the basic structure of the building is discernible on both the ground floor and the first floor. The entrance to the courtyard is from the north through a finely carved stone gateway. 自马穆鲁克时期以来，这里一直有一座客栈（khan）。目前的结构是由贪婪的苏莱曼（穆罕默德·阿里的军械师）建造的；其入口和立面于1937年列入名录。尽管有许多加建物，但在底层和一楼仍可辨认出建筑的基本结构。庭院的入口位于北面，通过一个雕刻精美的石门进入。",

The attribution (under either no. 614 or no. 352) of this structure is entirely erroneous, however, since excavations in the area revealed it to be nothing more than a continuation of the wall of Salah al-Din (no. 307). The position of the Ayyubid Bab al-Barqiya is probably the gate recently discovered slight ly to the south, and the confusion is compounded by the pres ence in the vicinity of both the Fatimid Bab al-Tawfiq (see U10), and the Bab al-Khala (no. [551]), both of which have also been identified as the Bab al-Barqiya. 该结构遗迹的位置标记在埃及测绘局1:500地籍图上，该图将其归为编号352（与地图页18上的北部法蒂玛城墙编号相同）。然而，对该结构（无论是在编号614还是352下）的归属完全是错误的，因为该地区的挖掘表明它只不过是萨拉赫·丁城墙（编号307）的延伸。阿尤布王朝巴基亚门（Bab al-Barqiya）的位置可能是最近在稍南处发现的城门，而这种混淆又因附近同时存在法蒂玛王朝的陶菲克门（Bab al-Tawfiq，见U10）和哈拉门（Bab al-Khala，编号[551]）而加剧，这两者也都曾被认定为巴基亚门。",
