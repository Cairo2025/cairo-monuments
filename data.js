    "description": "The wikalat al-Shishini is a late seventeenth-century AD wikala built for coffee merchants. It is more commonly known as the wikala of Sulayman Agha, after the ‘Controller of Armies’ for Muhammad ‘Ali. Sulayman Agha probably purchased the property in the nineteenth century, along with other buildings in the area; his eponymous mosque (no. 382) is located to the east (map sheet 18). The entire ground floor of the wikala is in a good state of preservation. Shishini 维卡拉（商栈）是一座建于公元17世纪晚期的维卡拉，专为咖啡商人建造。它更常被称为苏莱曼·阿迦（Sulayman Agha）维卡拉，以穆罕默德·阿里（Muhammad ‘Ali）时期的“军队总监”命名。苏莱曼·阿迦可能在19世纪购买了这处房产以及该地区的其他建筑；以他名字命名的清真寺（编号382）位于东面（地图页18）。整个维卡拉的一层保存完好。"

It is possible that it once formed part of a single large domicile with the above two houses, with a date far earlier than its superficial appearance would suggest. The house, owned by the SCA, was renovated in 2000. 这座两层楼的房子位于西海米（al-Sihaymi）住宅（编号339）和穆斯塔法·加法尔（Mustafa Gaf‘ar）住宅（编号471）之间。它可能曾经与上述两所房子共同组成一个巨大的单一住所，其年代远早于其表面外观所显示的年代。该房屋归古物最高委员会（SCA）所有，并于2000年进行了翻新。"

Today it lies hidden beneath the surface of Shari‘ Amir al-Guyush at its junction with Midan al-Gaysh. A small section of the wall connecting to it, running north-south, can still be seen slightly to the north of the gateway’s location, which appears to have been almost totally rebuilt by the Comité (see no. 352 above). 坎塔拉门（Bab al-Qantara）是巴德尔·贾马利（Badr al-Gamali）城墙的一部分，1920年由阿基里斯·帕特里科洛（Achille Patricolo，委员会技术局局长）进行的挖掘工作使其部分显露。今天，它隐藏在阿米尔·古尤什街（Shari‘ Amir al-Guyush）与盖什广场（Midan al-Gaysh）交汇处的地表之下。在该门位置稍北处，仍可见连接它的一小段南北走向的城墙，该城墙似乎几乎完全由委员会重建（见上文编号352）。"

    "description": "This Ottoman mosque is entered through a simple trilobed portal, to the left of which lies an inscribed marble plaque that belonged to a drinking-spout. The interior comprises a main prayer space, the roof of which is supported on a single antique column, with an ancillary tomb chamber. Shams al-Din al-Ramli (d. AD 1550) was the son of Shehab al-Din al-Ramli, a famous Shafi‘i master of jurisprudence (for whom the mosque was originally built): both father and son are buried in the tomb chamber. 这座奥斯曼清真寺通过一个简单的三叶形入口进入，入口左侧有一块刻有铭文的大理石牌匾，原属于一个饮水口。内部包括一个主要的祈祷空间（其屋顶由一根古董柱支撑）和一个附属的墓室。沙姆斯·丁·拉姆利（Shams al-Din al-Ramli，卒于公元1550年）是著名的沙斐仪派法学大师谢哈布·丁·拉姆利（Shehab al-Din al-Ramli）的儿子（清真寺最初是为父亲建造的）：父子俩都安葬在墓室中。"

    "description": "This Fatimid gateway to Cairo was excavated in 1960. Wiet (1961) identified it with the Bab al-Barqiya (no. 614). The gate is approximately three meters below ground level and consists of a simple pointed-arch stone vault; an inscription in marble attached to its face identifies Badr al-Gamali as its builder and gives the name of the gate and the date of its construction. A subsequent facing (also Fatimid) appears to have been added to the exterior of the vault to provide a machicoulis. The precise relationship between the Fatimid wall and the Ayyubid wall that runs a few meters to the east at this point can be resolved only through further excavation. 这座通往开罗的法蒂玛王朝城门于1960年出土。维耶（Wiet，1961）将其认定为巴基亚门（Bab al-Barqiya，编号614）。该门位于地平面以下约三米处，由一个简单的尖拱石拱顶组成；附在其表面的一块大理石铭文指明巴德尔·贾马利（Badr al-Gamali）是其建造者，并给出了门的名称和建造日期。随后的饰面（也是法蒂玛时期的）似乎被添加到了拱顶的外部，以提供一个防御突出的射孔（machicoulis）。此处法蒂玛城墙与向东延伸几米的阿尤布王朝城墙之间的确切关系，只能通过进一步的挖掘来解决。"

    "map_sheet": "5",
    "dating": "AH 566 (?) / AD 1170 (?)",
    "description": "This roughly semicircular defensive tower seems to lie on the line of the northeastern wall of Cairo originally constructed by Badr al-Gamali ca. AD 1087. The tower was probably part of Salah al-Din’s reconstruction of the walls of Badr al-Gamali before he undertook the project of building his own fortifications around the city in 1176. The French Expedition may have converted it to accommodate cannons in 1796. The tower is faced today in rough stonework with some dressed stone elements. It was given the number 17 in 1902 during the survey of the Ayyubid wall by the Austrian architect Edouard Matasek. 这座大致呈半圆形的防御塔似乎位于巴德尔·贾马利（Badr al-Gamali）约公元1087年最初建造的开罗东北城墙线上。该塔可能是萨拉赫·丁（Salah al-Din）重建巴德尔·贾马利城墙的一部分，之后他在1176年开始在城市周围建造自己的防御工事。法国远征军可能在1796年将其改建以容纳大炮。这座塔今天表面由粗糙的石制品和一些修整过的石材元素构成。在1902年奥地利建筑师爱德华·马塔塞克（Edouard Matasek）对阿尤布城墙进行勘测期间，它被赋予了编号17。"

    "description": "This plain Ottoman mosque is entered through a trilobed inscribed stone portal surrounded by decorative strapwork. Adjacent to the entrance is the surviving base of the minaret. The mosque itself (heavily renovated) is composed of two arched arcades carried on marble columns with Corinthian capitals. The shaykh after whom the mosque is named is buried in a room to the north, although it seems likely that the tomb dates later than the mosque itself. 这座简朴的奥斯曼清真寺通过一个刻有铭文的三叶形石门进入，周围环绕着装饰性的带状纹饰。入口旁边是幸存的宣礼塔基座。清真寺本身（经过大幅翻新）由两个拱形拱廊组成，拱廊由带有科林斯柱头的大理石柱支撑。以其名字命名该清真寺的谢赫葬在北面的一个房间里，尽管墓的年代似乎晚于清真寺本身。"

    "map_sheet": "12",
    "dating": "AH 1281 / AD 1864",
    "description": "This sabil-kuttab, built by the uncle of Khedive Tawfiq, is unique in that its façade curves away from, rather than into, the street that it borders. It is an extremely ornate building, even by the standards of the Muhammad ‘Ali period, with arched sabil openings clad in marble, heavily carved wooden eaves, brightly colored paintwork on the upper wooden loggia, and a clock integrated into the decorative schema of the first floor. Registered in the 1946–53 Bulletin without a number, the building has proved impossible to access; the interior is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education. 这座萨比尔-库塔布（公益汲水处兼古兰经学校）由赫迪夫·陶菲克（Khedive Tawfiq）的叔叔建造，其独特之处在于其立面向外弯曲，远离其相邻的街道，而不是向内凹进。这是一座极其华丽的建筑，即使以穆罕默德·阿里时期的标准来看也是如此，它拥有覆盖大理石的拱形萨比尔开口、大量雕刻的木制屋檐、上层木制凉廊上色彩鲜艳的油漆，以及一个融入一楼装饰方案的时钟。它在1946-53年的公报中登记但没有编号，事实证明该建筑无法进入；其内部受教育部管辖。"

    "description": "A wikala has stood on this site since AD 1554, but the present structure may be a later rebuilding. The wikala, with a sabil-kuttab, is located immediately to the north of the qa‘a of Muhib al-Din al Muwaqqi (no. 50). Its current use is domestic, which may account for its good state of preservation: both the ground floor and the first floor survive intact. 自公元1554年以来，这里一直矗立着一座维卡拉，但目前的结构可能是后来的重建。这座带有萨比尔-库塔布的维卡拉紧邻穆希布·丁·穆瓦基（Muhib al-Din al Muwaqqi）卡阿（宴会厅，编号50）的北面。它目前用于居住，这可能是其保存完好的原因：底层和二层都完好无损。"

    "description": "Raymond and Wiet (1979) suggest that this unusually named wikala (‘Eyes of the Gazelle’) may have been associated with a military officer called Yusuf ibn ‘Ain al-Gazal, active in the mid-seventeenth century. The wikala is tiny but well preserved. Its courtyard, roofed over in concrete at first-floor level, is occupied by diverse minor trades; the upper floors give an excellent idea of the traditional layout of such a building. Raymond和Wiet（1979）认为，这座名字独特（“羚羊之眼”）的维卡拉可能与一位名叫优素福·伊本·艾因·加扎尔（Yusuf ibn ‘Ain al-Gazal）的军官有关，他活跃于17世纪中叶。这座维卡拉很小但保存完好。它的庭院在一层用混凝土盖顶，被各种小型行业占用；上层楼层极好地展示了此类建筑的传统布局。"

It is known also historically as the hammam al-Bayatira or the hammam al-Saga. A bathhouse has existed on this site since the Fatimid period, although the present structure is probably Ottoman in date. It was registered as a monument in 1999 but has no number. 这座澡堂通常被称为“卡拉温（Qalawun）澡堂”，因为它靠近同名的建筑群，直到2002年仍在运营；地下水和污水渗漏导致其必须关闭。它在历史上也被称为兽医（al-Bayatira）澡堂或金匠（al-Saga）澡堂。自法蒂玛时期以来，此地就一直存在澡堂，尽管目前的结构可能属于奥斯曼时期。它于1999年登记为古迹，但没有编号。"

The rab‘ on the upper floors appears to date to the nineteenth century, but the stonework and corbeling of the ground floor indicate an earlier date for the foundation. Denoix et al. (1999) suggest a date comparable to that of the wikala of Gamal al-Din al-Dhahabi. 这座维卡拉（确切地说是一家炼糖厂，其通俗名称由此而来：“蜂蜜维卡拉”）位于南部贾马尔·丁·扎哈比（Gamal al-Din al-Dhahabi）维卡拉（编号411）的正对面。上层的拉布（rab‘，公寓）似乎可以追溯到19世纪，但底层的石雕和牛腿支撑表明其地基年代更早。Denoix等人（1999）认为其年代与贾马尔·丁·扎哈比维卡拉相当。"

His complex in the old Jewish Quarter of the city comprises an entrance court, subsidiary rooms, a backyard, and the main building. The synagogue seems to have been renovated in 1883 and most recently in the 1930s. Its plan combines both axial and centralized geometries. The lavishly decorated marble Torah Ark and pulpit are located on the cross-axis of the building, with a dome raised on four columns between them. The women’s gallery and stair leading to it are intact. The building was registered as a monument in 1987 but has no number. 著名的拉比和卡巴拉学者哈伊姆·卡普西（Ha‘im Capusi，公元1540-1631年）于1600年之前从马格里布抵达开罗。他被安葬在Basatin。他在该城旧犹太区的建筑群包括一个入口庭院、附属房间、后院和主楼。这座犹太会堂似乎在1883年进行过翻修，最近一次是在20世纪30年代。其平面布局结合了轴向和中心几何形状。装饰奢华的大理石托拉柜（Torah Ark）和讲坛位于建筑的横轴上，两者之间有一个由四根柱子支撑的圆顶。妇女席及其通往那里的楼梯保存完好。该建筑于1987年登记为古迹，但没有编号。"

His body was subsequently moved to Tiberias in Palestine. The synagogue itself has been rebuilt over the centuries; the last reconstruction, commemorating the 800th anniversary of Maimonides’ birth, likely dates to 1935. The complex comprises an entrance court with an inscribed portal, subsidiary rooms, and a square hall at a much lower level to the southeast; the latter (heavily rebuilt) are what remains of the original synagogue: the Ramban Yeshiva. The main building is roofless; a wooden Torah Ark is set on the eastern wall, and a raised marble pulpit at its center. The women’s gallery to the west is missing. The building was registered as a monument in 1986, but it has no number. 著名的犹太医生和拉比摩西·迈蒙尼德（Moses Maimonides）于公元1165年定居开罗，1204年去世后葬于这座犹太会堂。他的遗体随后被移至巴勒斯坦的提比里亚。犹太会堂本身在几个世纪中多次重建；最后一次重建是为了纪念迈蒙尼德诞辰800周年，可能是在1935年。该建筑群包括一个带有刻字入口的入口庭院、附属房间以及东南方一个地势低得多的方形大厅；后者（经过大量重建）是原始会堂——兰班耶希瓦（Ramban Yeshiva，犹太经学院）的遗存。主楼没有屋顶；东墙上安置着一个木制托拉柜（Torah Ark），中心是一个抬高的大理石讲坛。西侧的妇女席已缺失。该建筑于1986年登记为古迹，但没有编号。"

An adjacent building to the south, once belonging to the synagogue, has been demolished. 这座犹太会堂是一座简单的方形石制建筑，入口上方镶嵌着希伯来语的大理石铭文。西墙二楼有一个妇女席，目前似乎已失去了原有的通道。天花板上有一个巨大的木制椭圆形星芒图案，中心是一个天窗（或灯笼）。原本安装在东墙上的托拉柜已不在原位，该建筑现被用作车间。南面一座曾属于该会堂的相邻建筑已被拆除。"

Small Franciscan groups lived in Egypt for the next four hundred years, but it was not until 1630 that the first prefect of the order arrived in Cairo and took up residence in the Venetian Embassy. Attached to the present building is a large annex built in 1932 that houses the friary and the Bibliothèque du Centre Franciscain d’Études Orientales Chrétiennes. 这座古典风格的大教堂是方济各会在该地点建造的第三座教堂，自16世纪以来，该地点的一部分一直被威尼斯驻开罗大使馆占用。圣方济各于公元1219年访问埃及，并会见了阿尤布王朝苏丹马利克·卡米尔（Malik al-Kamil）。此后四百年间，方济各会的小团体一直居住在埃及，直到1630年，该修会的首位长官抵达开罗并入住威尼斯大使馆。现在的建筑附带有一个建于1932年的大型附楼，内设修道院和方济各会东方基督教研究中心图书馆。"

This takes the form of a vaulted room flanked by four other vaulted rooms, two on each side. The level of the foundation suggests that it may have been constructed during the nineteenth century, perhaps as part of the cemetery of al Ghurayib in this area, although the orientation of the building is not that of a tomb. It is included here principally to distinguish it from the adjacent wall, from which it is completely separate in time and space. 在该区域阿尤布城墙（见编号307）的挖掘过程中，发现了一个未确认的无窗石结构，其地层位置比城墙高得多。该结构呈拱形房间的形式，两侧各有两个拱形房间。地基的高度表明它可能建于19世纪，也许是该地区古赖布（al Ghurayib）公墓的一部分，尽管该建筑的朝向并非墓葬的朝向。将其列入此处主要是为了将其与相邻的城墙区分开来，两者在时间和空间上都是完全分离的。"

His tomb in this mosque is a much-venerated shrine. The mosque is approached through a trilobed portal with inlaid tiles and decorative strapwork. A baffled corridor leads into a prayer hall that preserves its two original arcades, supported on antique columns, although the mosque has been recently extended to the west. Only the antique parts of the plan are shown on the map sheet. The mihrab and marblework are all modern. The squinches of the dome over the tomb chamber are unusually complex for the period, although the construction above them is modern, as is the minaret above the main entrance. 艾哈迈德·达尔迪尔（Ahmad al-Dardir，公元1715-86年）是苏菲派哈尔瓦蒂教团（Khalawati order）的著名谢赫，其清真寺所在的街道便以他的名字命名。他在该清真寺内的陵墓是一个备受尊崇的圣地。清真寺通过一个镶嵌瓷砖和装饰性带状纹饰的三叶形入口进入。一条折形走廊通向祈祷大厅，大厅保留了由古董柱支撑的两个原始拱廊，尽管清真寺最近向西进行了扩建。地图上只显示了平面图中古老的部分。米哈拉布（壁龛）和大理石制品都是现代的。墓室圆顶的抹角拱结构对于那个时期来说异常复杂，尽管其上方的建筑结构是现代的，主入口上方的宣礼塔也是如此。"

It is built for the most part in a classical renaissance style, with the exception of the main portal, which has some rather baroque sweeps either side of it. This leads to a courtyard, off of which is located a staircase. The palace is partially occupied but is generally derelict. 这座大型两层宫殿占据了该城市街区的大部分，东侧以一座19世纪的扎维亚为界。除非主入口两侧有一些相当巴洛克风格的曲线外，它主要以古典文艺复兴风格建造。入口通向一个庭院，楼梯位于庭院旁。宫殿部分有人居住，但总体上已废弃。"

    "description": "The site of this building was originally a Fatimid mashhad for Sayyid Mu’ad (Sidi Ma‘az), who died in AD 907. The site was subsequently built on by the amir Abu’l Ghadanfar, who added a madrasa in 1157. All that remains from this date is the stuccoed-brick minaret, which manifests a transition from Fatimid to Ayyubid styles; the adjacent tomb of the saint is a fifteenth-century Mamluk addition, built of brick. There is one inscription in kufic over the entrance to the tomb and another mounted on the qibla wall. Stone walls lying to the west of the tomb may date from the earlier period of construction. The mosque that stands to the south of these structures is modern. 该建筑的原址最初是赛义德·穆阿德（Sidi Ma‘az，死于公元907年）的法蒂玛王朝圣地（mashhad）。随后，埃米尔阿布·加丹法尔（Abu’l Ghadanfar）在此基础上进行了建设，于1157年增建了一所伊斯兰学校（madrasa）。那个时期遗留下来的只有灰泥砖砌的宣礼塔，它体现了从法蒂玛风格向阿尤布风格的过渡；邻近的圣人墓是15世纪马穆鲁克时期的加建部分，由砖块建成。墓入口上方有一处库法体铭文，另一处镶嵌在基布拉墙（朝向麦加的墙）上。位于墓西侧的石墙可能源自早期的建造时期。矗立在这些建筑物南面的清真寺是现代建筑。"

    "description": "This gate, together with its counterpart the Bab al-Nasr (no. 7) and the section of wall between them (no. 352), was built by the Fatimid vizier Badr al Gamali in AD 1087. He moved the line of the original enclosure wall for the city of al-Qahira (built by Gawhar al-Siqilli in 969) out to its present position and employed stone for its construction rather than the bricks used by his predecessor. The Bab al-Futuh (‘the Gate of Conquests’) is a masterpiece of stonework and decorative detail, which has been exhaustively described by Creswell (1952). The ground level around the gate has risen considerably since its construction, leading to a false impression of its original vertical scale. The gate itself, as well as the section of wall between it and the Bab al Nasr, was restored between 2001 and 2003; urban clearance has taken place in the area immediately outside and a protective fence installed. A small, unidentified saint’s tomb is built within the doorway on its eastern flank. A round tower and a square stone tower containing a vast vaulted chamber, both built by Badr al-Gamali, are situated to the west of the gate. These towers are classified separately under no. 352. 这座城门与其对应的纳斯尔门（Bab al-Nasr，编号7）以及它们之间的城墙段（编号352），是由法蒂玛王朝的维齐尔巴德尔·贾马利（Badr al Gamali）于公元1087年建造的。他将卡希拉城（al-Qahira，由乔哈尔·西奇利于969年建立）的原始围墙线向外移至目前的位置，并使用石头代替前任使用的砖块进行建造。福图门（Bab al-Futuh，意为“征服之门”）是石造工艺和装饰细节的杰作，Creswell（1952）对此进行了详尽描述。自建造以来，城门周围的地面高度显著上升，导致人们对其原始垂直比例产生错误印象。城门本身以及它与纳斯尔门之间的城墙段在2001年至2003年间进行了修复；紧邻外侧的区域进行了城市清理并安装了防护栏。一个身份不明的小型圣人墓建在东侧的门道内。一座圆形塔楼和一座包含巨大拱形室的方形石塔（均为巴德尔·贾马利所建）位于城门西侧。这些塔楼被单独分类在编号352下。"

It was originally named the Bab al-Izz (‘the Gate of Glory’) but soon came to known as the Bab al-Nasr after the counterpart gate in Cairo’s first wall (now demolished) built by Gawhar al-Siqilli some two hundred meters to the south of the present emplacement. The same persistence of an older nomenclature applied to the Bab al Futuh, which was originally called the Bab al-Iqbal (‘the Gate of Prosperity’), but reverted to the name of the previous gate built by Gawhar. The square towers that flank the gate are decorated with heraldic shields carved in stone. A white marble inscription in kufic of the Shi‘a shahada (a very public proclamation of the Fatimid faith) is mounted above the portal. The gate was restored by the Comité at various times, and the latter organization also cleared the area outside the gate in the 1940s, removing the registered sabil of Salim Agha (no. [429]). The SCA undertook an extensive restoration of the Bab al-Nasr in 2001, which is yet to be completed at the time of writing. This has so far resulted in the replacement of many masonry elements. 纳斯尔门（Bab al-Nasr，意为“胜利之门”）在建筑上与其对应的福图门（Bab al-Futuh，编号6）的区别在于它拥有方形而非圆形的塔楼。它最初被命名为伊兹门（Bab al-Izz，意为“荣耀之门”），但很快就以开罗第一道城墙（现已拆除，由乔哈尔·西奇利在现址以南约两百米处建造）中的对应城门命名为纳斯尔门。这种旧名称的延续也发生在福图门上，它最初被称为伊克巴尔门（Bab al-Iqbal，意为“繁荣之门”），但也恢复了乔哈尔建造的前一道门的名称。大门两侧的方形塔楼装饰有石刻的纹章盾牌。门上方镶嵌着一块白色大理石，刻有库法体的什叶派清真言（Shahada，这是对法蒂玛信仰的非常公开的宣示）。该门曾多次由委员会修复，该组织还在1940年代清理了门外的区域，移除了已登记的萨利姆·阿迦（Salim Agha）萨比尔（编号[429]）。古物最高委员会（SCA）于2001年对纳斯尔门进行了广泛的修复，在撰写本文时尚未完成。到目前为止，这导致了许多砖石构件的更换。"

    "description": "This huge congregational mosque was started by the Fatimid khalif al-‘Aziz and completed by his son al-Hakim, who became one of the most notorious despots ever to rule Egypt. When started, the mosque occupied land outside the city walls built by Gawhar al-Siqilli, but it was subsequently included within the perimeter of the second set of walls built by Badr al Gamali (see no. 352). The building followed the precedent of the mosque of Ahmad ibn Tulun (no. 220), being constructed on the principle of arcades with piers and pointed arches and with a ziyada, or intermediate space, separating the interior of the mosque from the city around it. The mosque was restored after a great earthquake in AD 1302 by Baybars al Gashankir, who added the mabkharas to the original Fatimid minaret shafts. Sultan Hasan also restored the mosque in 1359, after which it fell into disuse and served variously as a prison, stables, fortress, and storehouse. During the last years of the nineteenth century it became home to Musée de l’Art Arabe prior to that institution’s relocation to the purpose built premises (U46) that it occupies (as the Islamic Museum) to this day. The Comité did much to reveal the true form of the minarets early in the twentieth century. The mosque remained largely ruined until major reconstruction took place in the 1980s directed by the Bohra Isma‘ili sect, which rebuilt all the arcades except for those on the qibla side, covered the sahn in marble, and remodeled the façade. In the course of the reconstruction, the mausoleum of Qurqumas (no. 170), originally situated immediately outside the entrance to the complex, was dismantled and reconstructed in the precincts of the funerary complex of Barsbay (monument no. 121) in the northern cemetery. 这座巨大的聚礼清真寺由法蒂玛哈里发阿齐兹（al-‘Aziz）动工，并由其子哈基姆（al-Hakim）完成，后者成为统治埃及的最臭名昭著的暴君之一。开工时，清真寺占据了乔哈尔·西奇利建造的城墙外的土地，但随后被纳入巴德尔·贾马利建造的第二道城墙范围内（见编号352）。该建筑遵循艾哈迈德·伊本·图伦清真寺（编号220）的先例，采用墩柱和尖拱构成的拱廊原则建造，并设有ziyada（外苑或中间空间），将清真寺内部与周围城市隔开。公元1302年大地震后，拜巴尔斯·加尚基尔（Baybars al Gashankir）修复了这座清真寺，并在原有的法蒂玛宣礼塔轴上增加了mabkharas（香炉状顶部结构）。苏丹哈桑也在1359年修复了这座清真寺，之后它便废弃不用，曾先后作为监狱、马厩、堡垒和仓库。在19世纪的最后几年，它成为了阿拉伯艺术博物馆的所在地，直到该机构迁至至今使用（作为伊斯兰博物馆）的专用场所（U46）。委员会在20世纪初为揭示宣礼塔的真实形态做了大量工作。直到1980年代在博拉伊斯玛仪派（Bohra Isma‘ili sect）的指导下进行大规模重建之前，该清真寺在很大程度上仍然是废墟。该教派重建了除基布拉侧以外的所有拱廊，用大理石覆盖了庭院（sahn），并改造了立面。在重建过程中，最初位于建筑群入口外的库尔库马斯陵墓（no. 170）被拆除，并在北部墓地的巴尔斯贝（Barsbay）葬礼建筑群（古迹编号121）范围内重建。"

It was al-Nasir who made him a polomaster (gukandar). Almalik also founded an important madrasa in Jerusalem. On the eastern façade, a bull’s-eye window pierces the building’s original ablaq trilobed portal, which is no longer in use today. A new entrance into the mosque, which contains the tomb of Shaykh Hasan al-‘Adawi (AD 1806–86), was added onto the southern side of the building, presumably after the adjacent buildings to the south were destroyed in the general remodeling of the area around the mosque of al-Husayn. Almalik’s mosque has no minaret and no dome: the founder’s tomb is in a single, tunnel-vaulted room at the southeastern corner of the building. The interior is remarkable for its stucco decoration: an inscription band runs along the walls of the sahn and iwans, and medallions ornament the western iwan. 这是开罗已知最早的带有覆盖庭院的十字形伊斯兰学校（madrasa）的例子。它由埃米尔阿尔马利克（Almalik，意为“果园”）·古坎达尔建造，他是扎希尔·拜巴尔斯的一名马穆鲁克，后来继续为卡拉温、纳西尔·穆罕默德及其五个儿子服务。正是纳西尔任命他为马球总管（gukandar）。阿尔马利克还在耶路撒冷建立了一所重要的伊斯兰学校。在东立面上，一个牛眼窗穿透了该建筑原本的阿布拉格（ablaq）三叶形入口，该入口如今已不再使用。清真寺包含谢赫哈桑·阿达维（Shaykh Hasan al-‘Adawi，公元1806-86年）的陵墓，其南侧增设了一个新入口，大概是在南面相邻建筑在侯赛因清真寺周边地区的一般改造中被摧毁之后。阿尔马利克的清真寺没有宣礼塔也没有圆顶：创建者的墓位于建筑东南角的一个单间筒形拱顶房间内。内部以其灰泥装饰而著称：一条铭文带沿着庭院（sahn）和伊万（iwans）的墙壁延伸，圆章装饰着西面的伊万。"

The building is known also as the mosque of Umm al-Ghulam for this reason. The saints’ tombs are contained in an underground vault to the south of the main portal; a slab with kufic inscription (mounted inside on the qibla wall of the mosque) states that Fatima’s tomb was constructed in AD 1254 by the amir Bilbak al-Khazindar. The mosque is now approached from a modern extension to the west; the main trilobed arched portal to the east, with a pierced muqarnas hood, is shut. The mosque itself is a columnar structure, with arcades of reused columns and capitals arranged around an open sahn. The tomb of the founder is located to the north, on the side street. A sabil-kuttab, now lost, was apparently attached to the complex at its northeastern corner. 埃米尔塔克塔拜·伊本·巴尔德巴克（Taqtabay ibn Bardbak）的清真寺和陵墓建在法蒂玛（侯赛因之母）和另一位女性圣人的早期墓地之上。因此，该建筑也被称为Umm al-Ghulam清真寺。圣人的墓位于主入口以南的一个地下拱顶中；一块刻有库法体铭文的石板（安装在清真寺内的基布拉墙上）说明法蒂玛的墓是由埃米尔比尔巴克·哈津达尔（Bilbak al-Khazindar）于公元1254年建造的。清真寺现在从西面的现代扩建部分进入；东面带有穿孔穆卡纳斯罩的主要三叶形拱门已关闭。清真寺本身是一个柱式结构，由重复使用的柱子和柱头组成的拱廊围绕着一个开放的庭院。创建者的墓位于北面，在侧街上。一个现已消失的萨比尔-库塔布显然曾附属于该建筑群的东北角。"

The building was originally attached to a mosque of the same name, which was demolished in 1892. When the midan between the mosques of al-Azhar and al-Husayn was opened up in the 1930s, the Comité moved the sabil in 1935–36 to its present position, at some distance to the north and west of the original emplacement (see also no. 57, the sabil-kuttab of Isma‘il ibn Ahmad). The building is single story, having lost its kuttab (if it ever had one), and is noteworthy for its carved stone strapwork, with a decorative wood surround to the sabil grille. There are two portals: that to the east is blocked, and was originally in the same plane as the rest of the façade. It was reconstructed at right angles to the main façade because the new site that had been assigned to the building was obviously too small. Since this sabil and its neighbor (no. 57 below) were moved, they have been consistently confused with each other. It is hoped that the identification provided here will prevail. The building was restored in 2003 by the SCA. Raymond（1979）将这座无铭文萨比尔的建造日期定为公元1640-41年（在古迹索引中被列为“17世纪中叶”）。该建筑最初附属于一座同名清真寺，后者于1892年被拆除。当爱资哈尔清真寺和侯赛因清真寺之间的广场在1930年代开辟时，委员会于1935-36年将萨比尔移至目前的位置，位于原址西北方一定距离处（另见编号57，伊斯梅尔·伊本·艾哈迈德的萨比尔-库塔布）。该建筑为单层，失去了它的库塔布（如果曾经有过的话），并因其雕刻的石制带状纹饰以及萨比尔格栅周围的装饰性木框而引人注目。有两个入口：东面的那个被封堵，原本与立面的其余部分处于同一平面。由于分配给该建筑的新场地明显太小，它被重建为与主立面成直角。自从这个萨比尔和它的邻居（下文编号57）被移动后，它们一直被混淆。希望此处提供的鉴定能够正本清源。该建筑于2003年由古物最高委员会（SCA）修复。"

    "description": "The head of Husayn, the martyred son of ‘Ali, is said to be buried here, and the site remains the most important place of pilgrimage in Cairo to this day. The head was first buried in a mashhad on this site by the Fatimid khalif al-Fa‘iz in AD 1154, and the building was reconstructed by Salih Negm al-Din Ayyub in 1237, only to be burnt down eleven years later. Subsequent restorations included those of Hasan Katkhuda al-Galfi in the early eighteenth century, ‘Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda later in the same century, and Khedive Isma‘il in the nineteenth century. The immediate environs of the tomb were subjected to major urban clearance in the mid-twentieth century. The existing mosque was designed, on the instructions of khedives ‘Abbas I and Isma‘il, in the neo-Gothic style. It was completed in 1873, with the exception of the new minaret, which was finished in 1878. A further matching extension that enlarged the area of the mosque was built in the 1950s. The only parts of the structure that are listed monuments today are the Ayyubid minaret, with fine original stucco decoration dating to 1237, and the gate directly beneath it, which was formerly called the Bab al-Hasanayn and is today called the Bab al-Akhdar. Portions of this gate may date to the original Fatimid foundation of 1154. The tomb chamber (the work of ‘Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda) was the object of a major restoration in 1985 supervised by the Egyptian Antiquities Organisation, during which a replacement dome made of steel was placed over it. For this reason, this section of the building is also shown on the map highlighted as if it were a registered monument, although it is not formally listed. 据说阿里的殉难之子侯赛因的头颅葬于此，该地点至今仍是开罗最重要的朝圣地。头颅最初于公元1154年由法蒂玛哈里发法伊兹（al-Fa‘iz）葬于此地的圣地（mashhad），该建筑于1237年由萨利赫·内格姆·丁·阿尤布（Salih Negm al-Din Ayyub）重建，但仅在11年后就被烧毁。随后的修复包括18世纪初的哈桑·卡特胡达·加尔菲（Hasan Katkhuda al-Galfi）、同世纪后期的阿卜杜勒·拉赫曼·卡特胡达以及19世纪的赫迪夫·伊斯梅尔。陵墓的紧邻环境在20世纪中叶经历了大规模的城市清理。现存的清真寺是根据赫迪夫阿巴斯一世和伊斯梅尔的指示，以新哥特式风格设计的。除新宣礼塔于1878年完工外，其余部分于1873年完工。1950年代又建造了一个扩建清真寺面积的配套建筑。该结构中唯一列为古迹的部分是阿尤布宣礼塔（拥有可追溯到1237年的精美原始灰泥装饰）及其正下方的门，该门原名哈萨奈因门（Bab al-Hasanayn），现称阿赫达尔门（Bab al-Akhdar）。这扇门的部分构件可能追溯到1154年的原始法蒂玛地基。墓室（阿卜杜勒·拉赫曼·卡特胡达的作品）是1985年由埃及古物组织监督的一项重大修复工程的对象，期间在其上方放置了一个钢制的替代圆顶。因此，尽管该建筑部分未正式列入名录，但在地图上也将其高亮显示，仿佛是已登记的古迹。"

    "description": "Baybars al-Gashankir (‘the Taster’), who became sultan for a year by temporarily deposing al-Nasir Muhammad, was also responsible for building the tops on the minarets of the nearby mosque of al-Hakim (no. 15). He was subsequently executed by al-Nasir Muhammad, who proceeded to obliterate his enemy’s name from the inscription band on the façade of the khanqah. Three elements of the complex are visible from the street: the minaret, portal, and tomb chamber. The minaret rises from a square base with a heavy muqarnas cornice, above which is set a circular second tier and mabkhara. The recess of the portal is framed, unusually, by a round-headed arch with cushion voussoirs, behind which stands the doorway itself, surmounted by a more conventional combination of semi-dome and muqarnas pendentives. The doors retain their fine metal revetments; the granite threshold is a reused piece of pharaonic spolia. Construction took place in two phases, with the mausoleum being added to the rest of the complex; this may account for the two separate dog-legged corridors leading from the vestibule beyond the portal to the tomb chamber and to the courtyard. The tomb chamber is preceded by another vestibule and is decorated with a marble dado, inlaid marble mihrab, and wooden inscription band. The plan of the khanqah is essentially cruciform, but the lateral iwans are here so compressed as to have minimal architectural impact. Instead, attention is drawn to the qibla and western iwans, which are large pointed-arch vaults. The western iwan has a malqaf incorporated into its rear wall; the qibla wall is undecorated. The flank walls of the sahn are occupied by three levels of accommodation for the Sufi students of the khanqah. The ancillary buildings to the south of the sahn, such as the kitchens, have largely disappeared, but the surviving endowment deed for the complex provides detailed information as to how the khanqah functioned. 拜巴尔斯·加尚基尔（Baybars al-Gashankir，意为“尝膳官”）曾通过暂时废黜纳西尔·穆罕默德而做了一年的苏丹，他也负责建造了附近的哈基姆清真寺（编号15）宣礼塔的顶部。他随后被纳西尔·穆罕默德处决，后者继而将他敌人的名字从汗卡立面的铭文带上抹去。从街道上可以看到建筑群的三个要素：宣礼塔、入口和墓室。宣礼塔从一个带有厚重穆卡纳斯飞檐的方形基座升起，上方是圆形的第二层和香炉状顶部（mabkhara）。入口的凹处不寻常地由一个带有垫状拱石的圆头拱框住，后面是门口本身，上方是更传统的半圆顶和穆卡纳斯帆拱组合。门保留了精美的金属饰面；花岗岩门槛是一块被重新利用的法老时期遗物。建造分两个阶段进行，陵墓是被添加到建筑群其余部分的；这可能解释了为何有两条分开的折角走廊从入口后的前厅通往墓室和庭院。墓室前面还有另一个前厅，装饰有大理石护壁、镶嵌大理石米哈拉布和木制铭文带。汗卡的平面本质上是十字形的，但侧面的伊万在这里被压缩得对建筑影响极小。相反，注意力被吸引到基布拉和西面的伊万，它们是巨大的尖拱拱顶。西面的伊万后墙结合了一个捕风塔；基布拉墙未作装饰。庭院的侧墙被汗卡苏菲派学生的三层住宿占据。庭院南面的附属建筑（如厨房）已基本消失，但现存的建筑群捐赠契约提供了关于汗卡如何运作的详细信息。"

    "description": "Founded by al-Ma’mun al-Bata‘ihi, the vizier of the Fatimid khalif al-Amir, this tiny mosque (nicknamed ‘the Moonlit’), has generated a considerable body of literature, not least because it was the first mosque in Cairo to have dual orientation: i.e., to the street on the outside and to the qibla within. It also has a remarkable decorated façade with a complex iconography related to Isma‘ili Shi‘a doctrine. The open sahn is surrounded by keel-arched arcades, supported by reused marble columns or, at the corners, by brick piers. Decoration is in the form of stucco inscription bands, which run along each arch, alternating with medallions. Most of what can be seen of the decoration today is a modern replacement. The building has undergone three major restorations in its history. The first of these was carried out by the amir Yalbugha (a mamluk of Barquq) in AD 1396. The second was executed by the Comité under the direction of Max Herz at the beginning of the twentieth century (including the partial clearance of encroachments from both inside and outside the mosque). The last restoration was that of the Bohra Isma‘ili sect in the 1990s, during which the southern half of the façade was rebuilt and much of the mosque’s decoration replaced. 这座小巧的清真寺（昵称“月光”，al-Aqmar）由法蒂玛哈里发阿米尔的维齐尔马蒙·巴塔伊希（al-Ma’mun al-Bata‘ihi）建立，它产生了大量的文献，不仅因为它是开罗第一座具有双重朝向（即外部面向街道，内部面向麦加基布拉）的清真寺。它还有一个非凡的装饰立面，带有与伊斯玛仪什叶派教义相关的复杂图像。开放的庭院被龙骨拱拱廊环绕，由重新利用的大理石柱支撑，或在角落由砖墩支撑。装饰形式为沿着每个拱门延伸的灰泥铭文带，与圆章交替。今天所能看到的大部分装饰都是现代替代品。该建筑在历史上经历了三次重大修复。第一次由埃米尔亚尔布加（Yalbugha，巴尔库克的马穆鲁克）于公元1396年进行。第二次由委员会在Max Herz的指导下于20世纪初执行（包括部分清除清真寺内外的侵占物）。最后一次修复是博拉伊斯玛仪派在1990年代进行的，期间重建了立面的南半部分，并更换了清真寺的大部分装饰。"

These two sections of the madrasa are linked by a common façade, which has the minaret at its approximate center. The tomb was a later addition to this madrasa, built in AD 1249 by Sultan Negm al-Din Ayyub’s wife, Shagarat al-Durr, but it established the much-followed precedent of building a tomb in association with a madrasa. The façade and the minaret of the complex were restored by the Comité at various times. The German Institute restored the tomb and the minaret of the complex in 1993–95. Despite considerable intrusive development, the northern section of the madrasa still retains its western iwan and the base of the eastern iwan. The southern section of the madrasa has been entirely demolished and the land that it occupied is, in 2004, a building site awaiting new construction. An archaeological investigation in 1995 revealed that Creswell’s reconstruction of this part of the complex, which rested on the remains of the Fatimid Eastern Palace, was substantially correct. At the extreme northern end of the complex stands the founder’s tomb. This has a dome of plastered brick, while more costly materials are reserved for the interior. A stucco inscription band runs along the walls; the mihrab preserves the first documented use of glass mosaic decoration in Muslim Egypt; the tabut over the grave, and other wooden elements, are finely carved. 萨利赫·内格姆·丁·阿尤布（Salih Negm al-Din Ayyub）的伊斯兰学校是埃及建造的第一所容纳所有四个法学派别的伊斯兰学校，它被一条直接从建筑群宣礼塔下方穿过的街道分成大致相当的两部分。这两部分由一个共同的立面连接，宣礼塔大致位于其中心。陵墓是这所伊斯兰学校的后期增建部分，由苏丹内格姆·丁·阿尤布的妻子沙格拉特·杜尔（Shagarat al-Durr）于公元1249年建造，但它确立了将陵墓与伊斯兰学校联合建造的广受遵循的先例。该建筑群的立面和宣礼塔曾多次由委员会修复。德国研究所于1993-95年修复了该建筑群的陵墓和宣礼塔。尽管有相当多的侵入性开发，伊斯兰学校的北段仍保留了其西面的伊万和东面伊万的基座。伊斯兰学校的南段已被完全拆除，其占据的土地在2004年是一个等待新建筑的工地。1995年的一项考古调查显示，Creswell对该建筑群这一部分的重建（基于法蒂玛东宫的遗迹）基本正确。在建筑群的最北端矗立着创建者的陵墓。它有一个灰泥砖圆顶，而更昂贵的材料则保留用于内部。一条灰泥铭文带沿着墙壁延伸；米哈拉布保留了穆斯林埃及首次有记载使用的玻璃马赛克装饰；坟墓上的棺椁（tabut）和其他木制元素雕刻精美。"

    "description": "The mosque was built by ‘Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda to commemorate Shaykh ‘Ali al-Mutahhar, who is buried here; according to Creswell (1922), the shaykh did not die until AD 1776–77, which implies that his tomb was constructed well in advance. ‘Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda’s mother is purportedly buried next to the shaykh’s domed tomb chamber. The site was previously occupied by the house of Ma’mun al-Bata‘ihi (the builder of the mosque of al Aqmar) and subsequently by an Ayyubid madrasa. The historic sections of this building fall into three discrete entities: 1. the entrance, minaret, and sabil-kuttab; 2. the corridor and arched annex; and 3. the main body of the mosque with the tomb chamber. The mosque is approached through a finely decorated trilobed portal, flanked to the north by the sabil-kuttab, which in elevation is identical to ‘Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda’s other, three-sided sabil-kuttab further down the Bayn al-Qasrayn (no. 21). The corridor from the street has a stone flanking wall and two open courts, and is preceded by a small arched annex, also used for prayer. The mosque itself has plain arched stone arcades and an inlaid marble mihrab; the tomb chamber is situated to the west of the mosque. 这座清真寺由阿卜杜勒·拉赫曼·卡特胡达建造，以纪念葬于此处的谢赫阿里·穆塔哈尔（‘Ali al-Mutahhar）；根据Creswell（1922）的说法，这位谢赫直到公元1776-77年才去世，这意味着他的墓是提前很久建造的。据称阿卜杜勒·拉赫曼·卡特胡达的母亲葬在谢赫的圆顶墓室旁边。该地点以前曾是马蒙·巴塔伊希（阿克马尔清真寺的建造者）的住宅，随后是一所阿尤布王朝的伊斯兰学校。该建筑的历史部分分为三个独立的实体：1. 入口、宣礼塔和萨比尔-库塔布；2. 走廊和拱形附楼；3. 清真寺主体和墓室。清真寺通过一个装饰精美的三叶形入口进入，北面是萨比尔-库塔布，其立面与阿卜杜勒·拉赫曼·卡特胡达在拜因·盖斯林（Bayn al-Qasrayn）更远处的另一个三面萨比尔-库塔布（编号21）完全相同。来自街道的走廊有一面石侧墙和两个开放式庭院，前面是一个小型的拱形附楼，也用于祈祷。清真寺本身有朴素的拱形石拱廊和一个镶嵌大理石的米哈拉布；墓室位于清真寺的西面。"

This remarkable group of buildings was begun and completed in only a year by the first of the Bahri Mamluk sultans: al-Mansur Qalawun; it is the earliest of a series of foundations built by successive sultans on the western side of Bayn al-Qasrayn. The mausoleum is remarkable for its size, its unique façade, and the wealth of ornamentation in its interior. It is approached by an imposing corridor that also gives access to the madrasa and used to lead into the bimaristan (now blocked). The mausoleum is preceded by a small courtyard lined with reused antique columns. The dome above the tomb chamber, supported on an octagonal arrangement of columns reminiscent of a baptistery, is a replacement in concrete by the Comité, modeled on the almost contemporaneous dome of the mausoleum of al-Ashraf Khalil (monument no. 275). The adjacent madrasa, noteworthy for the unique navelike design of the qibla iwan, was also heavily restored by the Comité. The remains of the bimaristan, the first hospital built in Cairo, are today accessed by a road to the south of the madrasa. Only peripheral fragments of this once-large structure remain, including a qa‘a built by one of the later directors of the hospital, the amir Aqqush, in AD 1320–30. The center of the site of the bimaristan is now occupied by an eye hospital. 卡拉温建筑群（自2002年起关闭修复）包括陵墓、伊斯兰学校和医院（bimaristan）。这组非凡的建筑由巴赫里马穆鲁克苏丹的第一位——曼苏尔·卡拉温（al-Mansur Qalawun）在仅一年内动工并完成；它是历代苏丹在拜因·盖斯林（Bayn al-Qasrayn）西侧建立的一系列地基中最早的一个。陵墓以其规模、独特的立面和内部丰富的装饰而著称。它通过一条宏伟的走廊进入，该走廊也通向伊斯兰学校，并曾经通往医院（现已封堵）。陵墓前有一个排列着重新利用的古董柱的小庭院。墓室上方的圆顶由让人联想到洗礼堂的八角形柱列支撑，是委员会用混凝土进行的替代品，模仿了几乎同时期的阿什拉夫·哈利勒陵墓（古迹编号275）的圆顶。相邻的伊斯兰学校以基布拉伊万独特的类似教堂中殿的设计而闻名，也经过了委员会的大力修复。医院（开罗建造的第一家医院）的遗迹今天通过伊斯兰学校南面的一条道路进入。这座曾经巨大的结构仅存外围碎片，包括医院后来的主管之一埃米尔阿库什（Aqqush）在公元1320-30年建造的一个卡阿（qa‘a）。医院遗址的中心现在被一家眼科医院占据。"

The complex is distinguished on the street by its portal, which was taken from the Crusader cathedral at Acre, and its carved stucco minaret. Beneath this, a corridor leads into the sahn, which contains a large stone basin. To the south of the corridor, the qibla iwan of the madrasa preserves a ten-meter-high mihrab with a carved stucco hood. To the north lies the tomb chamber, where two painted wood inscription bands at high level survive. Al-Nasir’s son, Anuk (d. AD 1340), is buried here, while al-Nasir himself is interred next door in his father Qalawun’s mausoleum (no. 43). The dome over the tomb collapsed in 1870 and has never been replaced. The complex was restored by the German Institute in 1985–86 (the portal was conserved and restored in 1999–2000), and the remains of an ablutions court in the southwestern corner of the site were first excavated in 1998. Since 2002 the complex has been closed for further restoration by the SCA. 该建筑由苏丹基特布加（Kitbugha）动工，苏丹纳西尔·穆罕默德完成，是开罗建造的第一所明确旨在容纳所有四个法学派别的十字形伊斯兰学校。该建筑群在街道上以其取自阿克（Acre）十字军大教堂的入口大门和雕刻灰泥宣礼塔而著称。在其下方，一条走廊通向包含一个大石盆的庭院（sahn）。走廊以南，伊斯兰学校的基布拉伊万保留了一个十米高的米哈拉布，带有雕刻灰泥罩。北面是墓室，那里保留了两条高处的彩绘木铭文带。纳西尔的儿子阿努克（死于公元1340年）葬于此，而纳西尔本人则葬在隔壁他父亲卡拉温的陵墓（编号43）中。墓上方的圆顶于1870年坍塌，从未更换。该建筑群于1985-86年由德国研究所修复（入口大门于1999-2000年进行了保护和修复），遗址西南角的沐浴庭院遗迹于1998年首次被挖掘出来。自2002年以来，该建筑群已关闭，由古物最高委员会（SCA）进行进一步修复。"

The sabil has a fine painted wooden ceiling and the whole structure has been recently restored by the SCA (2003). The building is still confused with its neighbor (al-Bazdar), not only in the Map of Mohammedan Monuments where the labelings are unclear, but also on the ground (see SCA 2002).

    "description": "‘Abd al-Basit was the controller of the armies under Sultan al-Mu’ayyad Shaykh; his influence declined, however, with the accession of Sultan Barsbay, and Sultan Barquq had him executed in AD 1450. Before this, he had endowed not only a fine mosque in Cairo but also madrasas in Jerusalem, Mecca, and Damascus. His foundation in Cairo takes the form of a cruciform madrasa with two stone portals, a minaret, and a sabil-kuttab. The decorative stone and wood elements throughout are of high quality. It was restored at various times by the Comité, but most of the building is orginal. In 2003 the mosque was still undergoing a lengthy conservation. Immediately opposite the eastern façade of the mosque stood the monumental entrace to the nineteenth-century palace of the al-Bakri family, seen in a photograph published by Pauty (1933a, pl. viib). This was demolished in the 1950s and replaced with modern school buildings. 阿卜杜勒·巴西特（‘Abd al-Basit）是苏丹穆阿亚德·谢赫统治时期的军队总监；然而，随着苏丹巴尔斯贝的继位，他的影响力下降，苏丹巴尔库克（注：此处原文“Sultan Barquq”有误，应为当时的苏丹，因巴尔库克死于1399年，1450年时为苏丹贾克马克）于公元1450年将其处决。在此之前，他不仅在开罗捐赠了一座精美的清真寺，还在耶路撒冷、麦加和大马士革建立了伊斯兰学校。他在开罗的地基采用十字形伊斯兰学校的形式，有两个石门、一座宣礼塔和一个萨比尔-库塔布。各处的装饰性石木元素品质极高。它曾多次由委员会修复，但大部分建筑是原物。2003年，清真寺仍在进行漫长的保护工作。就在清真寺东立面的正对面，曾矗立着19世纪巴克里（al-Bakri）家族宫殿的宏伟入口，见Pauty（1933a，图版viib）发表的照片。这在1950年代被拆除，取而代之的是现代学校建筑。"

    "description": "Founded by the Fatimids as the principal congregational mosque of the royal city of al-Qahira, the mosque of al-Azhar (‘the Shining’) has undergone numerous additions and extensions over time. It has functioned as a teaching center more or less since its foundation, attracting students from all parts of the Islamic world. The most notable surviving Fatimid components of the mosque are the keel-arches in the courtyard, the dome behind the central arch of the courtyard on the qibla side, and the stucco conch of the mihrab on the central axis. During the Mamluk period, individually dedicated madrasas were added to the north and west of the main courtyard. To the southwest lies the madrasa of the amir Taybars (AD 1309), whose fine marble inlaid mihrab survives. To the northwest lies the madrasa of the amir Aqbugha, with its adjacent domed tomb chamber and minaret (1333–39). To the northeast is the small but finely decorated madrasa of the eunuch Gawhar (the treasurer of Sultan Barsbay), whose tomb here is adorned with a carved masonry dome (1440). Sultan Qaytbay built a gateway (1468) and minaret (ca. 1495) on the central axis to the west of the courtyard. The largest minaret of the mosque was added by Sultan al-Ghuri in 1510; it contains a double-helix spiral stair and is topped by a two finials that are square in plan. During the Ottoman period, ‘Abd al-Rahman Katkhuda significantly enlarged the riwaqs on the qibla side and added (in 1751–52) two distinctive double-arched gateways to the southern and western perimeters, another portal on the east, and three minarets (two of which survive). His tomb is located on the southeastern side of the mosque. At the beginning of the twentieth century, Khedive ‘Abbas II Hilmi built a large extension to house the students and a library on the southern and western sides of the complex. The original context for the mosque, and its ancient ablutions area, were destroyed from the 1930s onward by the development of Shari‘ al-Azhar as a major thoroughfare and by the creation of the new al-Azhar University campus to the east of the mosque. The entire mosque was heavily restored and cleaned in 1998–2000. 爱资哈尔（al-Azhar，“光辉”）清真寺由法蒂玛王朝建立，作为皇城卡希拉（al-Qahira）的主要聚礼清真寺，随着时间的推移经历了无数次的增建和扩建。自成立以来，它或多或少一直作为教学中心运作，吸引了来自伊斯兰世界各地的学生。清真寺最著名的幸存法蒂玛构件是庭院中的龙骨拱、基布拉一侧庭院中央拱门后的圆顶以及中轴线上米哈拉布的灰泥半圆顶。在马穆鲁克时期，单独献纳的伊斯兰学校被添加到主庭院的北面和西面。西南方是埃米尔泰巴尔斯（Taybars）伊斯兰学校（公元1309年），其精美的大理石镶嵌米哈拉布幸存下来。西北方是埃米尔阿克布加（Aqbugha）伊斯兰学校，及其相邻的圆顶墓室和宣礼塔（1333-39年）。东北方是太监乔哈尔（Gawhar，苏丹巴尔斯贝的财政官）的小型但装饰精美的伊斯兰学校，他在那里的墓装饰有雕刻砌体圆顶（1440年）。苏丹盖特贝在庭院西侧的中轴线上建造了一个大门（1468年）和宣礼塔（约1495年）。清真寺最大的宣礼塔由苏丹古里于1510年增建；它包含一个双螺旋楼梯，顶部有两个方形平面的尖顶。在奥斯曼时期，阿卜杜勒·拉赫曼·卡特胡达显着扩大了基布拉一侧的回廊（riwaqs），并增加了（1751-52年）两个独特的双拱门到南部和西部周边，另一个入口在东部，以及三座宣礼塔（其中两座幸存）。他的墓位于清真寺的东南侧。20世纪初，赫迪夫阿巴斯二世·希尔米在建筑群的南侧和西侧建造了一个大型扩建部分，以容纳学生和图书馆。清真寺的原始环境及其古老的沐浴区自1930年代起因爱资哈尔街作为主要通道的发展以及清真寺以东新爱资哈尔大学校园的建立而被破坏。整个清真寺在1998-2000年间进行了大力修复和清洁。"

The prayer space consists of two arcades supported on reused antique columns; traces of the original painted ceiling survive. The mihrab and minbar are not original. To the north, behind a large mashrabiya screen, is the stone-vaulted tomb area with a separate stone mihrab surrounded by strapwork. 这座扎维亚（zawiya）通过一个带有装饰性石制带状纹饰的三叶形入口进入，侧翼是一个保留了窗格栅上方部分木铭文的小型萨比尔。整个立面目前被严重地重绘覆盖。入口通过一条保留有原始彩绘木天花板的短走廊通向一个开放式庭院，庭院东面是扎维亚本体和以其名字命名该建筑的谢赫的墓地。祈祷空间由支撑在重新利用的古董柱上的两个拱廊组成；原始彩绘天花板的痕迹幸存下来。米哈拉布和敏巴尔不是原物。北面，在一个巨大的马什拉比耶屏风后面，是石拱顶墓区，带有一个单独的被带状纹饰包围的石制米哈拉布。"

    "description": "Kafur (‘camphor’) was an Anatolian eunuch who became supervisor of Sultan Farag ibn Barquq’s harim in the Citadel in AD 1408 and later served al Mu’ayyad Shaykh as treasurer before retiring to Medina and heading the corps of eunuchs that guarded the Prophet’s tomb. He died in 1427. A fine inscription band runs across the mosque’s northern and eastern façades. The physical evidence suggests that the eastern façade originally continued some way to the south. The main portal has inlaid marble geometric kufic panels as well as a lower-level stone inscription. The building’s plan is cruciform, with greatly abbreviated lateral iwans. The courtyard was once covered; little of the roof survives, but a high-level inscription band with the blazon of the founder is still visible. The qibla iwan’s painted wood ceiling, raised on large wooden squinches, is almost certainly a later addition, for it cuts across the windows in the façade. An Ottoman sabil-kuttab, which has two fine stone corbels, stands adjacent to the northwestern corner of the building. These components indicate that the entire mosque was remodeled during the Ottoman period. 卡福尔（Kafur，“樟脑”）是一位安纳托利亚太监，于公元1408年成为苏丹法拉吉·伊本·巴尔库克在城堡后宫的主管，后来担任穆阿亚德·谢赫的财政官，之后退休至麦地那并领导守卫先知墓的太监队伍。他死于1427年。一条精美的铭文带贯穿清真寺的北立面和东立面。实物证据表明，东立面最初向南延伸了一段距离。主入口有镶嵌大理石的几何库法体面板以及下方的石刻铭文。该建筑的平面呈十字形，侧面伊万大大缩减。庭院曾经是被覆盖的；屋顶几乎没有幸存，但带有创建者纹章的高处铭文带仍然可见。基布拉伊万的彩绘木天花板架在巨大的木制抹角拱上，几乎可以肯定是一个后来的添加物，因为它切断了立面上的窗户。一个奥斯曼萨比尔-库塔布（拥有两个精美的石牛腿）毗邻建筑的西北角。这些构件表明整座清真寺在奥斯曼时期进行了改造。"

Two pairs of magnificently carved doors from the Fatimid structure were reused; these were the first parts of the mosque to be registered in 1908, with the remainder of the building, including a sabil-kuttab, following in 1937. The interior has a large number of antique columns, perhaps also reused from the earlier structure. The building takes the form of a courtyard mosque raised above shops; in this case, the courtyard is roofed and has a skylight. There is a painted wood cornice throughout the arcades and a tiled surround to the upper level of the mihrab. The mosque was restored by the SCA in the late 1990s, and the southwestern section of the building has been totally rebuilt. 这座清真寺昵称“水果商清真寺”，由艾哈迈德·卡特胡达·哈尔布特利（Ahmad Katkhuda al Kharbutli）于公元1735年在法蒂玛哈里发扎菲尔（al-Zafir，1149-54年在位）的清真寺遗址上建造。两对来自法蒂玛结构的一流雕刻门被重新利用；这些是该清真寺于1908年首先登记的部分，建筑的其余部分，包括一个萨比尔-库塔布，于1937年登记。内部有大量古董柱，可能也是从早期结构中重新利用的。该建筑采用建在商店上方的庭院清真寺形式；在这种情况下，庭院是有屋顶的，并有一个天窗。整个拱廊都有彩绘木飞檐，米哈拉布的上层有瓷砖围边。清真寺于1990年代后期由古物最高委员会（SCA）修复，建筑的西南部分已完全重建。"

The mosque’s southern façade was heavily rebuilt by the Comité, with large areas of new stonework and new crenellations. There are three inscription bands on the main portal on the southern façade and on the subsidiary portal on the western façade. The ribbed plastered-brick dome over the tomb chamber is in good condition, with a rare tile-mosaic inscription band that is largely intact on the northern side of the drum (the complementary inscription band, on the drums’s south, is entirely missing). Only the lower story of the minaret is original. The sahn, probably open originally, was roofed by the Comité with a steel structure. The painted ceilings of the qibla and south iwans are intact; those in the other iwans are recent replacements. A wooden inscription band (most of it illegible or replaced, except in the qibla iwan) runs across the interior. The mihrab of the mosque is plain, with a few fragments of the original marble revetment in place, and that in the tomb chamber has a fine stucco hood. A wooden dikka occupies the western iwan. 亚斯拉姆（Aslam，苏丹纳西尔·穆罕默德的持剑官）很可能首先在遗址上建造了他的墓，随后建造了清真寺，因为该墓拥有一个现在位于清真寺内部的高度装饰的阿布拉格入口。清真寺的南立面由委员会进行了大力重建，使用了大面积的新石方和新城垛。在南立面的主入口和西立面的次要入口上有三条铭文带。墓室上方的肋状灰泥砖圆顶状况良好，带有一个罕见的瓷砖马赛克铭文带，在鼓座的北侧基本完好（鼓座南侧的互补铭文带完全缺失）。只有宣礼塔的下层是原物。庭院（sahn）最初可能是开放的，被委员会用钢结构加了屋顶。基布拉伊万和南伊万的彩绘天花板完好无损；其他伊万的天花板是近期的替代品。一条木制铭文带（除基布拉伊万外，大部分已难以辨认或被更换）贯穿内部。清真寺的米哈拉布朴素无华，只剩下几块原有的石材饰面碎片，而墓室内的米哈拉布有一个精美的灰泥罩。一个木制迪卡（dikka，诵经台）占据了西面的伊万。"

The founder, an important amir of Sultan Qaytbay, died in Damascus. The mosque is built on a triangular plot, and is connected by a bridge to its ablutions court on the other side of a street to the northwest. It is one of the most lavishly decorated of the Qaytbay-period monuments and was heavily restored by the Comité in 1896. It would seem that the listing does not extend to the hawd (occupied by a shop) and kuttab (still in use as a school) also on the other side of the street to the northwest. The complex takes the form of a cruciform madrasa, with a sabil, minaret, dome over the tomb chamber, and two portals. The main portal faces west and is embellished with ablaq decoration (also found over the window heads). The secondary portal (on the eastern façade) is today disused. The whole building is constructed above shop units, which are today substantially underground. The sabil (which has a separate access from the street) is derelict, but a fine salsabil with wooden muqarnas hood and a painted wood ceiling is preserved within. 这座清真寺更常以谢赫阿布·胡莱拉（Abu Hurayra）或哈里巴（Hariba）的名字为人所知，他于19世纪葬于此。创建者是苏丹盖特贝的一位重要埃米尔，死于大马士革。清真寺建在一个三角形地块上，并通过一座桥连接到西北面街道对面的沐浴庭院。它是盖特贝时期装饰最奢华的古迹之一，并于1896年由委员会进行了大力修复。名录似乎并未延伸至西北面街道另一侧的饮水槽（hawd，被商店占用）和库塔布（仍用作学校）。该建筑群采用十字形伊斯兰学校的形式，设有一个萨比尔、宣礼塔、墓室圆顶和两个入口。主入口朝西，饰有阿布拉格装饰（也见于窗头上方）。次要入口（在东立面）如今已废弃。整座建筑建在商店单元之上，这些商店今天基本上处于地下。萨比尔（有一个从街道进入的单独入口）已废弃，但内部保留了一个带有木制穆卡纳斯罩的精美萨尔萨比尔和一个彩绘木天花板。"

    "description": "This mosque was built by the wazir of the Fatimid khalif al-Fa‘iz: the amir al-Salih Tala’i‘. The building, an early example of a mosque built above shop units, takes the form of a courtyard surrounded by arcades of antique columns. The ground level around the building has risen by two to three meters since its construction; the entire structure is now surrounded by an artificial trench that allows access to the shop units (some of which are still in use). The interior is approached through an unusual portico of keel-arches (a Comité reconstruction) supported on antique columns. The mashrabiya screens to either side of the portico are copies of the original maqsura screens (now in the Islamic Museum), as are the bronze-plated doors. There are two subsidiary entrances on the northern and southern façades. The most significant restoration work carried out on the mosque was executed by the Comité in the 1920s and 1930s, when the building was disengaged from the accretive structures that surrounded it and most of the façades entirely reconstructed. The original arcades are those on the qibla side: the lateral arcades and the western, or entry, arcade are reconstructions by the Comité, which rebuilt much of the mosque to conform to their idea of what such a Fatimid mosque should look like. During this process, a Mamluk replacement for the northern arcade and a Mamluk/Ottoman minaret were demolished. The keel-arches of the qibla riwaqs are decorated with a band of carved stucco inscription around their perimeter, and they are connected to one another with carved wood tie-beams. Little of the Mamluk mihrab’s decoration survives. The fine wooden minbar with panels of geometric decoration, endowed on the mosque in AD 1300 by the amir Baktimur al-Gukandar, was restored in 1998 by the EAP. Subsequent to this, another (extremely heavy) restoration of the entire building has been carried out by the SCA. 这座清真寺由法蒂玛哈里发法伊兹（al-Fa‘iz）的维齐尔埃米尔萨利赫·塔拉伊（al-Salih Tala’i‘）建造。该建筑是建在商店单元之上的清真寺的早期例子，采用围绕古董柱拱廊的庭院形式。自建造以来，建筑周围的地面高度上升了两到三米；整个结构现在被一条人工沟渠包围，以便进入商店单元（其中一些仍在使用）。内部通过一个不寻常的龙骨拱门廊（委员会重建）进入，该门廊由古董柱支撑。门廊两侧的马什拉比耶屏风是原始马克苏拉（maqsura）屏风（现于伊斯兰博物馆）的复制品，青铜镀层门也是如此。北立面和南立面有两个次要入口。清真寺最重要的修复工作由委员会在1920年代和1930年代进行，当时该建筑从周围的增建结构中分离出来，大部分立面完全重建。原始拱廊是基布拉一侧的那些：侧面拱廊和西面（或入口）拱廊是委员会的重建作品，他们重建了清真寺的大部分以符合他们对法蒂玛清真寺应有样貌的设想。在此过程中，北拱廊的马穆鲁克替代品和一座马穆鲁克/奥斯曼宣礼塔被拆除。基布拉回廊的龙骨拱周围装饰有一条雕刻灰泥铭文带，并用雕刻木系梁相互连接。马穆鲁克米哈拉布的装饰几乎没有幸存。精美的带有几何装饰面板的木制敏巴尔（讲坛），由埃米尔巴克提穆尔·古坎达尔（Baktimur al-Gukandar）于公元1300年捐赠给清真寺，于1998年由EAP修复。此后，古物最高委员会（SCA）对整座建筑进行了另一次（极其繁重的）修复。"

The mosque has an inscribed trilobed portal, a sabil-kuttab with a reused antique column at the southwestern corner of the site, a minaret located directly over the main entrance, and a stone ribbed dome. The kuttab is a rebuilding by the Comité. The internal plan of the mosque is a simple four-iwan structure. 也被称为伊纳尔·阿塔巴基（Inal al-Atabaki），创建者是苏丹沙班二世的一位埃米尔。他的建筑群类似于稍北面的马哈茂德·库尔迪建筑群（见编号117），但有一个重要的例外：平面是正交的，内部没有针对基布拉进行调整；结果是基布拉朝向与该地区其他清真寺有很大不同。分布在整个建筑中的纹章表明伊纳尔是苏丹的军械师（silahdar）。清真寺有一个刻字的三叶形入口、一个位于地块西南角利用古董柱的萨比尔-库塔布、一座直接位于主入口上方的宣礼塔和一个石制肋状圆顶。库塔布是委员会的重建作品。清真寺的内部平面是一个简单的四伊万结构。"

There are three inscriptions on the portal, one of which takes the form of an inlaid geometric kufic panel. The stone masonry dome over the tomb chamber has chevrons and a carved inscription on its surface. The minaret (also incribed) is located to the right of the entrance. Much of the building’s decoration survives, including bronze window grilles, doors, marble pavements, and a beautiful muqarnas ceiling in the entry vestibule. The painted wood ceilings of the qibla and southern iwans are original, that of the western iwan is substantially new, and that of the northern iwan is in extremely bad condition—the result of an obvious failure of the roof. The mihrab has lost its marble lining; the minbar, although original, is heavily overpainted. Modern shop units to the south of the building conceal the remains of a subsidiary portal with an empty inscription band. 该建筑的创建者是苏丹巴尔斯贝的一名马穆鲁克。尽管建筑群包含一座陵墓，但加尼巴克（Ganibak）在25岁早逝且死因可疑后，被巴尔斯贝葬在北部墓地的后者建筑群中的另一座陵墓里。清真寺有两个开间的立面，通过一个带有穆卡纳斯的三叶形阿布拉格入口进入。入口上有三处铭文，其中一处采用镶嵌几何库法体面板的形式。墓室上方的石砌圆顶表面有其人字纹和雕刻铭文。宣礼塔（也刻有铭文）位于入口右侧。该建筑的许多装饰幸存下来，包括青铜窗格栅、门、大理石路面和入口前厅中美丽的穆卡纳斯天花板。基布拉和南伊万的彩绘木天花板是原物，西伊万的天花板主要是新的，北伊万的天花板状况极差——这是屋顶明显失效的结果。米哈拉布失去了大理石衬里；敏巴尔虽然是原物，但被严重重绘。建筑南面的现代商铺单元掩盖了一个带有空铭文带的次要入口的遗迹。"

It is a large, richly decorated courtyard mosque with two major portals to the north and west and a minor portal to the south. The original context of the western portal (which is decorated) is uncertain, since it no longer faces a significant street. Although the southern portal, in contrast, faces a street, it is plain. The decorated northern portal has fine marble work and two inscription bands. A further inscription band runs across the upper part of the mosque’s crenellated perimeter wall. The original minaret and wooden dome above the mihrab, supported on antique granite columns, are in good condition; the upper tier of the minaret and the dome are Comité replacements. The outer qibla arcade was entirely rebuilt by the Comité during extensive restorations from 1895 to 1903. The fountain pavilion in the center of the sahn was brought from the madrasa of Sultan Hasan (no. 133)—one of two originally in that madrasa—and installed at the same time (it has recently been totally reconstructed). Crenellations line the perimeter of the courtyard, which is flanked on the side of the qibla arcades by a magnificent inscribed turned-wood screen, and on the northern and southern sides by low marble balustrades. The wooden screen may have been built to screen off the qibla arcades from pedestrian traffic using the mosque as a shortcut between streets. The qibla wall has a fine marble dado and inlaid marble mihrab, adjacent to which is the original minbar. The foundation inscription is mounted on the northern wall within the qibla arcades. 这座清真寺由埃米尔阿勒通布加·马里达尼（Altunbugha al-Maridani，苏丹纳西尔·穆罕默德的斟酒官兼女婿）建造。这是一座装饰华丽的大型庭院清真寺，在北面和西面有两个主要入口，在南面有一个次要入口。西入口（有装饰）的原始环境不确定，因为它不再面向重要的街道。相比之下，虽然南入口面向街道，但它很朴素。装饰性的北入口有精美的大理石作品和两条铭文带。另一条铭文带沿着清真寺齿状围墙的上部延伸。原始的宣礼塔和米哈拉布上方的木制圆顶（由古董花岗岩柱支撑）状况良好；宣礼塔的上层和圆顶是委员会的替代品。外部基布拉拱廊在1895年至1903年的广泛修复中由委员会完全重建。庭院（sahn）中心的喷泉亭是从苏丹哈桑伊斯兰学校（编号133）搬来的——原为该伊斯兰学校中的两个之一——并同时安装在此（最近已完全重建）。庭院周边排列着城垛，基布拉拱廊一侧是一个宏伟的刻字车木屏风，南北两侧是低矮的大理石栏杆。木制屏风可能是为了将基布拉拱廊与使用清真寺作为街道间捷径的行人交通隔离开来而建造的。基布拉墙有一个精美的大理石护壁和镶嵌大理石米哈拉布，旁边是原始的敏巴尔。奠基铭文安装在基布拉拱廊内的北墙上。"

The complex he built on the Shari‘ Mu‘izz li-Din Allah includes a cruciform madrasa, minaret, sabil-kuttab, and tomb. Barsbay himself is buried in his funerary complex in the northern cemetery (monument no. 121), although various members of his family are interred here. The façade of the complex, covered in distinctive red-and-yellow ablaq masonry, has a continuous high-level inscription band and crenellation. The minaret has a square base with a muqarnas cornice, above which is set a circular second tier and mabkhara. The stone masonry dome, raised on scrolled corners over the tomb chamber, is carved with a chevron pattern. The portal, with a muqarnas hood and ablaq decoration, leads to a vestibule, which also gives access to the sabil. From here, a dog-legged corridor extends to the sahn, dominated by the qibla iwan, which contains an inlaid marble dado and mihrab and a Comité-period painted wood ceiling. The inlaid wood-and-ivory minbar is original. The western iwan retains its original ceiling; the high-level inscription band that runs around the sahn is unusual in providing details of the endowment that was made upon the madrasa. In 2002 a pair of remarkable interlinked circular-plan cisterns was discovered under the sabil of the complex, supported at their centers by monolithic granite columns (see SCA 2002). 巴尔斯贝（Barsbay）是苏丹穆阿亚德·谢赫的一名马穆鲁克，于公元1422年即位苏丹，并施行仁政直至1438年去世。他在穆伊兹·利丁·安拉街上的建筑群包括一所十字形伊斯兰学校、宣礼塔、萨比尔-库塔布和陵墓。巴尔斯贝本人葬于北部墓地的葬礼建筑群（古迹编号121），尽管他的许多家庭成员都葬于此。建筑群的立面覆盖着独特的红黄相间阿布拉格砌体，有一条连续的高处铭文带和城垛。宣礼塔从一个带有穆卡纳斯飞檐的方形基座升起，上方是圆形的第二层和香炉状顶部。墓室上方架在卷轴角落上的石砌圆顶刻有人字纹图案。带有穆卡纳斯罩和阿布拉格装饰的入口通向一个前厅，该前厅也通往萨比尔。从这里，一条折形走廊延伸至庭院（sahn），庭院由基布拉伊万主导，基布拉伊万包含一个镶嵌大理石护壁和米哈拉布以及一个委员会时期的彩绘木天花板。镶嵌木材和象牙的敏巴尔是原物。西伊万保留了原来的天花板；环绕庭院的高处铭文带不同寻常，提供了关于伊斯兰学校捐赠的详细信息。2002年，在建筑群萨比尔下方发现了一对非凡的相互连接的圆形蓄水池，中心由整块花岗岩柱支撑（见SCA 2002）。"

It later took the name of the qadi Sharaf al-Din, who converted the qa‘a into a mosque shortly after the construction of the palace was completed. The building’s context changed dramatically in the early twentieth century with the construction of Shari‘ al-Azhar, to which it is adjacent. The entrance to the mosque, set back from the road to the west (now out of use), is part of Sharaf al-Din’s work. This is a fine square-headed portal with ablaq and muqarnas, which seems more appropriate for the entrance to a palace than a mosque. The ground level adjacent to the building has risen by two meters, and the mosque is approached by descending a steep flight of stairs. There is a painted wood ceiling in the northern iwan, and a one-meter-wide wood inscription band survives on the northern side of the building. 这座清真寺是一个大型改建的卡阿（qa‘a），类似于塔什塔穆尔（no. 153）、沙基尔·伊本·加纳姆（no. 96）和艾哈迈德·贝伊·科希亚（no. 521）的那些，最初是穆希布·丁·叶海亚（Muhib al-Din Yayha）在公元1317年至1337年间建造的宫殿的一部分。它后来以卡迪·沙拉夫·丁（Qadi Sharaf al-Din）的名字命名，他在宫殿建成后不久将卡阿改建为清真寺。随着20世纪初相邻的爱资哈尔街的建设，该建筑的环境发生了巨大变化。清真寺的入口从西面的道路（现已停用）向后退缩，是沙拉夫·丁工程的一部分。这是一个带有阿布拉格和穆卡纳斯的精美方头入口，这似乎更适合宫殿入口而非清真寺。毗邻建筑的地面高度上升了两米，进入清真寺需要下一段陡峭的楼梯。北伊万有一个彩绘木天花板，建筑北侧保留了一条一米宽的木制铭文带。"

The sabil, situated on the northern end of the wikala, has lost its kuttab, although it retains a large decorated stone portal. The wikala seems to be composed of two courtyards, whose peripheral arches can barely be discerned among later accretions, which are occupied by metal-working trades. The entrance to the wikala is directly opposite the wikalat al-Muhammadayn (no. 597); the character of the masonry suggests that the two buildings had the same patron. Hanna (1998) has posited that the two wikalas were built by the seventeenth-century merchant Isma‘il Abu Takiya and his partner ‘Abd al-Qadir al-Damiri, and she identifies the wikala attached to the sabil-kuttab al-Kirdani as the wikalat al-Kubra (‘the Larger’), and the wikalat al-Muhammadayn (no. 597) as the wikalat al-Sughra (‘the Smaller’). 此名录不仅包括萨比尔-库塔布本身，还包括与其相连的维卡拉（也称为阿布·塔基亚[Abu Takiya]维卡拉）的立面和入口。位于维卡拉北端的萨比尔已失去其库塔布，尽管它保留了一个大型装饰石门。维卡拉似乎由两个庭院组成，其周边的拱门在后来的加建结构中几乎难以辨认，目前被金属加工行业占用。维卡拉的入口正对着穆罕默德（al-Muhammadayn）维卡拉（编号597）；砖石工程的特征表明这两座建筑由同一赞助人建造。汉娜（Hanna，1998）认为这两个维卡拉是由17世纪商人伊斯梅尔·阿布·塔基亚及其合伙人阿卜杜勒·卡迪尔·达米里（‘Abd al-Qadir al-Damiri）建造的，她将附属于基尔达尼（al-Kirdani）萨比尔-库塔布的维卡拉认定为大维卡拉（wikalat al-Kubra），将穆罕默德维卡拉（编号597）认定为小维卡拉（wikalat al-Sughra）。"

Barquq himself was re-interred in the northern cemetery in the khanqah built by his son Farag some years later (monument no. 149). The complex on the Bayn al-Qasrayn is a masterpiece of integrated design and decorative detailing. The crenellated façade has recessed window panels with muqarnas heads and a high-level inscription band. At the complex’s northern end stands the tomb chamber, the dome of which is a late nineteenth-century brick replacement for a plastered wood original that had collapsed. The minaret that rises adjacent to this is unusual in being heavily carved and patterned, the second tier bearing a motif of intersecting circles with inlaid marble. The portal has a semi-dome (supported by muqarnas pendentives), ablaq decoration, and a fine marble inscription. This leads through a groin-vaulted vestibule to a bent entrance that gives access to the sahn. The floors of the madrasa are paved with geometric patterns of colored marble. A fountain occupies the center of the sahn, with a wooden dome above it supported on marble columns, and an inscription band runs at high level above the pointed-arched iwans that define the space. On the qibla side, pairs of granite columns stand to either side of the central axis within the iwan, creating a tripartite space. An inlaid marble dado and mihrab, together with an elaborately decorated and gilded wooden ceiling, gives this iwan a particularly rich appearance. Liturgical furniture includes a fine minbar (a later endowment by Sultan Gaqmaq) and a wooden dikka. The tomb chamber matches the qibla iwan in the lavish use of marble decoration. To the west are located the students’ living units, which are largely ruined today and occupied by squatters. 这座主要建筑群由埃及第一位布尔吉（Burgi）马穆鲁克苏丹扎希尔·巴尔库克（al-Zahir Barquq）建造，包括一所十字形伊斯兰学校、一座陵墓和一所供125名学生使用的汗卡（khanqah）。巴尔库克本人后来被重新安葬在北部墓地，即其子法拉吉（Farag）数年后建造的汗卡中（古迹编号149）。位于拜因·盖斯林（Bayn al-Qasrayn）的这座建筑群是综合设计和装饰细节的杰作。带有城垛的立面拥有凹进的窗板，配有穆卡纳斯顶部和高处的铭文带。在建筑群的北端矗立着墓室，其圆顶是19世纪后期的砖制替代品，原为已坍塌的灰泥木结构。紧邻其升起的宣礼塔不同寻常，雕刻和图案繁复，第二层带有镶嵌大理石的相交圆图案。入口有一个半圆顶（由穆卡纳斯帆拱支撑）、阿布拉格装饰和精美的大理石铭文。这通过一个交叉拱顶的前厅通向一个折角入口，从而进入庭院（sahn）。伊斯兰学校的地板铺有彩色大理石的几何图案。庭院中心有一个喷泉，上方有由大理石柱支撑的木制圆顶，一条铭文带在界定空间的尖拱伊万上方高处延伸。在基布拉一侧，成对的花岗岩柱矗立在伊万内中轴线的两侧，形成一个三部分的空间。镶嵌大理石护壁和米哈拉布，连同装饰精美且镀金的木制天花板，赋予了这个伊万特别丰富的外观。礼拜家具包括一个精美的敏巴尔（后来由苏丹贾克马克捐赠）和一个木制迪卡（dikka，诵经台）。墓室在大理石装饰的奢华使用上与基布拉伊万相匹配。西面是学生的居住单元，如今大部分已成废墟并被擅自占地者占据。"

The precise date of the building’s construction is unknown; a funduq has stood on this site since the Mamluk period. A fine square door with extravagantly decorated muqarnas corbels to either side leads into a groin-vaulted passageway that once connected to the courtyard of the wikala, the structure of which has largely been destroyed or overbuilt. 尽管这座维卡拉与相邻的清真寺（编号42）同名，但它（以一位早期创建者的名字）也被称为埃米尔维卡拉（wikala of al-Amir）。该建筑的确切建造日期不详；自马穆鲁克时期以来，这里一直有一座芬杜克（funduq，客栈/商栈）。一扇精美的方形门，两侧带有装饰奢华的穆卡纳斯牛腿，通向一条交叉拱顶通道，该通道曾经连接到维卡拉的庭院，庭院的结构已大部分被破坏或被加盖。"

    "description": "This is a cruciform madrasa, built above a remarkably dense complex of shop units and internal streets. It has an unusual square minaret with three tiers and a fine decorated ablaq portal. An inscription band runs above the window recesses at high level. The upper stories of the building contain cells for Sufi students. This foundation of Sultan al-Ghuri constitutes one half of an architectural ensemble that straddles the Qasaba: the counterpart structure, on the eastern side of the street, includes his mausoleum and a sabil-kuttab (see no. 67 above). The interior of the mosque follows a cruciform plan, with the iwans fronted by large pointed arches. The decorative treatment of all surfaces is lavish: particularly noteworthy is the deep muqarnas band that runs along the top of the sahn. A cycle of restoration at the mosque, undertaken by the SCA, was completed in 2000. The house to the north of the madrasa included in this listing was substantially demolished by the creation of Shari‘ al-Azhar; what remains is disfigured by modern shop fronts. 这是一所十字形伊斯兰学校，建在极其密集的商铺单元和内部街道之上。它拥有一座不同寻常的三层方形宣礼塔和一个装饰精美的阿布拉格入口。一条铭文带在窗户凹处上方的高处延伸。建筑的上层包含供苏菲派学生居住的小室。苏丹古里的这个地基构成了跨越卡萨巴（Qasaba，主干道）的建筑群的一半：街道东侧的对应结构包括他的陵墓和萨比尔-库塔布（见上文编号67）。清真寺的内部遵循十字形平面，伊万前面有巨大的尖拱。所有表面的装饰处理都非常奢华：特别值得注意的是沿着庭院顶部延伸的深穆卡纳斯带。古物最高委员会（SCA）对清真寺的一轮修复工作于2000年完成。此名录中伊斯兰学校北面的房屋因爱资哈尔街的修建而被大幅拆除；剩下的部分被现代店面破坏了外观。"

    "dating": "AH 823 / AD 1420",
    "description": "Sultan al-Mu’ayyad Shaykh built this mosque in fulfillment of a vow he made while incarcerated in the notorious prison that previously occupied the site. This is an enormous courtyard mosque, elevated above shops, with the main doors taken from the madrasa of Sultan Hasan (no. 133). The walls at the north, south, and west were rebuilt by the Ministry of Endowments in 1874. The towering portal, with ablaq masonry, granite door jambs, and inlaid inscriptions, stands on the eastern side of the building. Of the three minarets originally constructed for the mosque, only the two on top of the Bab Zuwayla (no. 199) survive, inscribed with the name of their architect. The original route into the mosque was probably from the vestibule through the northern corridor, but visitors proceed today directly to the qibla arcades from a door on the southern side of the vestibule through the domed tomb chamber of the sultan. The outermost arcade was rebuilt in 1874 after its collapse and is distinguished by its plain ceiling, unlikes the heavily painted ceilings of the other original arcades. An original inscribed marble dikka stands in the center of the outermost original arcade. The qibla wall and mihrab are magnificent examples of inlaid marble technique. Some Ottoman tiles also survive at the southern end of this wall at high level. The inlaid and carved woodwork on the original minbar and doors to the tomb chambers is of a similarly high standard. The dome over the southern tomb chamber, intended for the female members of the sultan’s family, may never have been completed, and this space now has a flat timber roof. A staircase constructed by the Comité outside the southeastern corner of the mosque leads up to the platform of the Bab Zuwayla. The mosque’s twin minarets (their finials are Comité restorations) stand atop the two flanking towers of the Fatimid gate, with their supporting structure passing through the lower level of the towers. The courtyard of the mosque contains a domed ablution fountain; this is not an original feature, as the area would have been simply paved in Mamluk times. To the west of the courtyard is the complex’s bathhouse (no. 410). A major project to restore the mosque and rebuild the southern, northern and western arcades was initiated in 2000. During the course of this work, excavations revealed the foundation of the Fatimid city wall within the mosque (indicated on the map sheet in dashed lines). This has subsequently been covered over. 苏丹穆阿亚德·谢赫为了履行他在之前占据该地点的臭名昭著的监狱中被囚禁时许下的誓言而建造了这座清真寺。这是一座巨大的庭院清真寺，高架在商店之上，大门取自苏丹哈桑的伊斯兰学校（编号133）。北、南、西面的墙壁由宗教基金部于1874年重建。高耸的入口位于建筑东侧，拥有阿布拉格砌体、花岗岩门框和镶嵌铭文。在最初为清真寺建造的三座宣礼塔中，只有祖韦拉门（Bab Zuwayla，编号199）顶部的两座幸存下来，上面刻有建筑师的名字。进入清真寺的原始路线可能是从前厅通过北走廊，但今天的游客是从前厅南侧的一扇门直接穿过苏丹的圆顶墓室进入基布拉拱廊。最外面的拱廊在倒塌后于1874年重建，其特点是朴素的天花板，不同于其他原始拱廊色彩浓重的彩绘天花板。一个原始的刻字大理石迪卡（dikka）矗立在最外层原始拱廊的中心。基布拉墙和米哈拉布是镶嵌大理石工艺的宏伟典范。一些奥斯曼瓷砖也幸存在这面墙南端的高处。原始敏巴尔和墓室门上的镶嵌及雕刻木制品也具有同样高的水准。南墓室上方的圆顶原打算供苏丹家族女性成员使用，可能从未完工，该空间现在有一个平坦的木屋顶。委员会在清真寺东南角外建造了一个楼梯，通向祖韦拉门的平台。清真寺的双宣礼塔（其尖顶是委员会修复的）矗立法蒂玛城门两侧的塔楼之上，其支撑结构穿过塔楼的下层。清真寺的庭院包含一个圆顶沐浴喷泉；这不是原始特征，因为该区域在马穆鲁克时期应该只是铺砌的。庭院西面是建筑群的澡堂（编号410）。一项修复清真寺并重建南部、北部和西部拱廊的重大项目于2000年启动。在工程过程中，挖掘工作揭示了清真寺内的法蒂玛城墙地基（在地图页上以虚线标示）。这随后被覆盖了。"

The current access to the upper and lower platforms of the gate is from a staircase to the west of the gate, and is a construction of the Comité. The original access, now blocked, lies to the east of the gate, and was within the thickness of the curtain wall, which can be seen from the upper platform. The gate was heavily restored by the Comité, and it was cleaned and restored from 1999 to 2003 (together with the minarets of al-Mu’ayyad Shaykh) by the EAP. Recent excavations have revealed the level of the Fatimid pavement below the gate’s entrance to be some three meters below ground level. 祖韦拉门（Bab Zuwayla）标志着巴德尔·贾马利建造的卡希拉围墙的南界。对其建筑最完整的描述可以在克莱斯韦尔（Creswell，1952）的著作中找到。它由两座巨大的圆形正面塔楼组成，塔楼顶部是穆阿亚德·谢赫清真寺（编号190）的双宣礼塔。目前通往城门上下平台的通道来自城门西侧的一个楼梯，这是委员会建造的。原来的通道现已被封堵，位于城门东侧，在幕墙的厚度内，从上层平台可以看到。该城门曾由委员会进行过大力修复，并于1999年至2003年由EAP（连同穆阿亚德·谢赫的宣礼塔一起）进行了清洁和修复。最近的挖掘显示，城门入口下方的法蒂玛路面高度在地面以下约三米处。"

Safiya managed to appropriate all of ‘Uthman’s property after his death. The mosque is raised high off the ground and is approached by large semicircular stairs on three sides. These entrances lead to a columned forecourt, with domes around its perimeter, that precedes a domed prayer hall. The mihrab is lined with a Mamluk-style marble revetment, and the minbar is constructed of marble. A wooden gallery sits above the western entrance wall; another runs along the base of the dome. The subsidiary dome to the northeast does not seem to cover a tomb as one might expect. The minaret is intact, although the mosque has lost the garden that once surrounded it (see no. 330). 这座清真寺由马利卡·萨菲亚（Malika Safiya，即索菲亚，苏丹穆拉德三世的威尼斯妻子，穆罕默德三世的母亲）的首席黑人太监乌斯曼·阿迦（‘Uthman Agha）建造。萨菲亚在乌斯曼死后设法侵吞了他的所有财产。清真寺高出地面，通过三面的大型半圆形楼梯进入。这些入口通向一个圆柱前院，周边有圆顶，前院通向圆顶祈祷大厅。米哈拉布内衬马穆鲁克风格的大理石饰面，敏巴尔由大理石建造。西入口墙上方有一个木制回廊；另一个沿着圆顶底部延伸。东北面的附属圆顶似乎并不像人们预期的那样覆盖着墓地。宣礼塔完好无损，尽管清真寺已经失去了曾经环绕它的花园（见编号330）。"

    "dating": "AH 263–65 / AD 876–79",
    "description": "The mosque of Ibn Tulun—the oldest and largest extant mosque within the area of Historic Cairo—follows a model imported from Samarra: a courtyard with arcades around it resting on brick piers, which is surrounded by a ziyada, or additional walled space, on all sides except that of the qibla. The many gates within this outer wall originally led to streets outside the perimeter of the building. The whole mosque is built on a rocky outcrop called the Gebel Yashkur. The outer wall of the ziyada and the outer wall of the mosque itself are topped by a plastered-brick crenellation of a unique interlocking design. The level of the mosque is raised slightly above that of the ziyada, which contains another remarkable feature on the northern side: a stone minaret with an external staircase. The western side of the ziyada contains a sabil built by Sultan Qaytbay (see U119). The minaret is certainly of later date; at least part of it was constructed in AD 1297 by Sultan Lagin, who also commissioned the stone fountain pavilion with a dome in the center of the courtyard of the mosque. (The exact dating of the minaret remains a subject of controversy among architectural historians.) It is possible that the spiral form of the minaret’s upper section was derived from the mosque’s original minaret, which may have followed a Samarran spiral prototype. It is the only minaret in Cairo with a staircase situated on the outside of its shaft. On the qibla side of the mosque, half of the original foundation inscription is mounted on a pier. Two other piers contain flat stucco mihrabs: one is a Fatimid example (commissioned by the vizier al-Afdal) and the other an archaizing Mamluk example (by Lagin). Another flat stucco mihrab, dating to the thirteenth century, is located on the qibla wall to the left of the central mihrab. A dikka on marble columns in front of the mihrab is a later addition by Lagin, who also commissioned the mosque’s fine minbar. Much of the mosque’s ceiling has been replaced, but fragments of a wooden inscription band in kufic that ran across the top of the qibla arcades can still be seen. Sections of the original stamped and carved stucco patterns adorning the soffits of the arches of the arcades are also visible. The outer wall of the mosque is pierced at high level by more than a hundred windows with stucco grilles, each of which has its individual geometric design. The major restoration works undertaken in the mosque by the Comité during the early part of the twentieth century included the rebuilding of the fallen outer arcade on the qibla side of the courtyard, the restoration of the fountain, the unblocking of all the arches, the demolition of buildings encroaching onto the ziyada, the replacement of the roofs, the landscaping of the courtyard/ziyada/surrounds, and the demolition of a Mamluk minaret in the southeastern corner of the building. Another (heavily criticized for its use of concrete in the courtyard and steel reinforcement in the walls) restoration of the mosque by the SCA commenced in 2000 and is drawing to a close in 2004. 伊本·图伦清真寺（Mosque of Ibn Tulun）是开罗历史城区现存最古老、最大的清真寺，遵循从萨迈拉（Samarra）引进的模式：庭院四周是有砖墩支撑的拱廊，除基布拉一侧外，四周被ziyada（外苑或附加围墙空间）环绕。外墙内的许多大门最初通往建筑周边的街道。整座清真寺建在一个名为亚什库尔山（Gebel Yashkur）的岩石露头上。外苑的外墙和清真寺本身的外墙顶部都有独特连锁设计的灰泥砖城垛。清真寺的高度略高于外苑，外苑北侧包含另一个显著特征：一座带有外部楼梯的石制宣礼塔。外苑西侧有一个由苏丹盖特贝建造的萨比尔（见U119）。宣礼塔肯定是后来的作品；至少部分是由苏丹拉金（Sultan Lagin）于公元1297年建造的，他还委托建造了清真寺庭院中心的带圆顶的石制喷泉亭。（宣礼塔的确切年代仍是建筑历史学家争论的主题。）宣礼塔上部的螺旋形式可能源自清真寺的原始宣礼塔，后者可能遵循了萨迈拉的螺旋原型。它是开罗唯一一座楼梯位于塔身外部的宣礼塔。在清真寺的基布拉一侧，一半的原始奠基铭文安装在一个墩柱上。另外两个墩柱包含平面灰泥米哈拉布：一个是法蒂玛时期的例子（由维齐尔阿夫达尔委托），另一个是仿古的马穆鲁克例子（由拉金委托）。另一个可追溯到13世纪的平面灰泥米哈拉布位于中央米哈拉布左侧的基布拉墙上。米哈拉布前大理石柱上的迪卡（dikka）是拉金后来添加的，他还委托制作了清真寺精美的敏巴尔。清真寺的大部分天花板已被更换，但仍能看到横跨基布拉拱廊顶部的库法体木制铭文带的碎片。装饰拱廊拱腹的原始压印和雕刻灰泥图案的部分也清晰可见。清真寺的外墙在高处开有百余扇窗户，带有灰泥格栅，每扇都有独特的几何设计。委员会在20世纪初对清真寺进行的重大修复工作包括重建庭院基布拉一侧倒塌的外部拱廊、修复喷泉、疏通所有拱门、拆除侵占外苑的建筑、更换屋顶、庭院/外苑/周边的景观美化，以及拆除建筑东南角的一座马穆鲁克宣礼塔。古物最高委员会（SCA）于2000年开始对清真寺进行另一项修复（因在庭院中使用混凝土和在墙壁中使用钢筋加固而受到严厉批评），该工程于2004年接近尾声。"

(It has also been commonLy given the name of the other sabil: Muhammad Katkhuda Mustahfizan.) Part of the confusion about the identity of the founder may stem from changes in ownership and multiple inscriptions (see Raymond [2000]). The sabil has an unusual form in that its façades are obliquely aligned to the street, which curves at this point. The ground level has risen here to the level of the sabil grilles, which are of bronze and contain some surviving inserts with the name of Allah. There is a marble inscription in Turkish over one grille and tiled lunettes over both. The interior, which contains an original marble salsabil, was once lined in blue-and-white tiles, many of which have gone missing. The water distribution room has a further inscription in Arabic around the ceiling. The waqf of Yusuf Agha also included a wikala to the northwest of the sabil (U39). 这座古迹位于米赫曼达尔清真寺（编号115）以西的达尔布·艾哈迈尔（Darb al Ahmar）拐角处，未在1:5000穆罕默德古迹地图上标记，并在古迹索引中与另一个萨比尔（编号150）混淆。（它也常被赋予另一个萨比尔的名字：穆罕默德·卡特胡达·穆斯塔菲赞。）关于创建者身份的部分混淆可能源于所有权变更和多重铭文（见Raymond [2000]）。该萨比尔的形式不同寻常，因为它的立面与街道倾斜排列，街道在此处弯曲。这里的地面高度已上升至萨比尔格栅的水平，格栅是青铜的，包含一些幸存的刻有真主之名的插件。一个格栅上方有土耳其语的大理石铭文，两个格栅上方都有瓷砖半月窗。内部包含一个原始的大理石萨尔萨比尔，曾经内衬蓝白瓷砖，其中许多已经丢失。配水室天花板周围还有阿拉伯语铭文。优素福·阿迦的瓦克夫还包括萨比尔西北方的一个维卡拉（U39）。"

Both houses have significant remnants of Mamluk building: a doorway bearing the cartouches of Sultan Qaytbay, and dating to ca. AD 1480, stands in the eastern courtyard, while an enormous qa‘a stands at ground level off the western courtyard. There is a fine Ottoman qa‘a at second-floor level overlooking the Shari‘ al-Tabbana, with painted wood ceilings and elaborate mashrabiyas. The only surviving maq‘ad is in the western courtyard, to the north of the (partially collapsed) groin-vaulted stone entrance onto the Suq al-Silah, which seems to have become the principal entrance to the combined residences. The entire property came into the hands of Ahmad Katkhuda al-Razzaz in the late eighteenth century, and it was no doubt modified to suit the needs of its new owners. Perhaps the two courtyards were linked during this period. The site is currently undergoing selective conservation by the EAP and the SCA. 这座庞大的三层宫殿——最初是被小巷隔开的两座独立住宅——围绕两个庭院建造，从巴布·瓦齐尔街（在此处称为al-Tabbana）延伸到苏克·西拉（Suq al-Silah，武器市场），在这两条干道上都有入口。两座房子都有重要的马穆鲁克建筑遗迹：东庭院中矗立着一个带有苏丹盖特贝椭圆徽章的门口，可追溯至约公元1480年，而西庭院旁的一层则有一个巨大的卡阿。二楼有一个俯瞰Tabbana街的精美奥斯曼卡阿，配有彩绘木天花板和精致的马什拉比耶。唯一幸存的马卡德位于西庭院，在通往苏克·西拉的（部分倒塌的）交叉拱顶石入口的北面，该入口似乎已成为合并后住宅的主入口。整个房产在18世纪后期落入艾哈迈德·卡特胡达·拉扎兹（Ahmad Katkhuda al-Razzaz）手中，毫无疑问，为了适应新主人的需求，它被进行了修改。也许两个庭院就是在此期间连接起来的。该地点目前正由EAP和古物最高委员会（SCA）进行选择性保护。"

    "description": "The layout of this building—a raised arcaded courtyard built above shops—resembles that of the much earlier takiya of Sulayman Pasha (no. 225). It differs from its predecessor, however, in that it has a bow-fronted sabil-kuttab added onto its southern end. It was built for Sultan Mahmud by the black eunuch Bashir Agha, who had already built his own foundation (the sabil-kuttab, no. 309) opposite. The crenellated façades of the building have two continuous decorative bands of arabesques running around them, and there are three portals. The main portal, which leads into a domed vestibule with stairs leading up to the raised courtyard, is a pointed arch with cushioned voussoirs, decorative strapwork framing, tiled inlay panels, flanking marble columns, and marble inscriptions. The portal leading to the sabil, also on the west elevation, is of simpler design, with surrounding strapwork and decorative banding. The third portal, located on the south elevation, gives access to a staircase leading to the kuttab and is flanked by marble columns, over which stands a pointed arch with a decorative strapwork and banded frame. The courtyard has a central baldachin on four columns at its center, and is surrounded by an arcade of columns that relates to an outer ring of cell units with shallow pendentive domes. There is a small zawiya on the north side. The interior of the building is now occupied by the offices of the main inspectorate of the SCA’s Coptic and Islamic Section (South Sector). The sabil’s interior with blue-and-white Iznik-style tiles has an inlaid-marble floor and decorative painted wood ceiling. The windows to the sabil have been half bricked-up, but two of their fine floral-style bronze grilles are intact. The arcade around the kuttab above has been enclosed with a modern glazed screen with stained-glass stucco grille overpanels, but the double eaves (the upper of which is scalloped) following the curved plan of the sabil, are unaltered. 该建筑的布局——建在商店上方的抬高的拱廊庭院——类似于早得多的苏莱曼帕夏塔基亚（编号225）。然而，与其前身不同的是，它的南端增加了一个弓形前部的萨比尔-库塔布。它是黑人太监巴希尔·阿迦（Bashir Agha）为苏丹马哈茂德建造的，巴希尔·阿迦已经在对面建立了自己的地基（萨比尔-库塔布，编号309）。该建筑的齿状立面有两条连续的蔓藤花纹装饰带环绕，共有三个入口。主入口通向一个圆顶前厅，有楼梯通往抬高的庭院，是一个带有垫状拱石的尖拱，配有装饰性带状纹饰框架、瓷砖镶嵌面板、侧翼大理石柱和大理石铭文。通往萨比尔的入口也位于西立面，设计较为简单，周围有带状纹饰和装饰带。第三个入口位于南立面，通向通往库塔布的楼梯，两侧有大理石柱，上方是一个带有装饰性带状纹饰和带状框架的尖拱。庭院中心有一个由四根柱子支撑的中央华盖，周围环绕着柱廊，与外圈带有浅帆拱圆顶的小室单元相连。北侧有一个小扎维亚。该建筑内部现被古物最高委员会（SCA）科普特和伊斯兰部门（南部）的主要监察办公室占用。萨比尔内部饰有蓝白伊兹尼克风格瓷砖，拥有镶嵌大理石地板和装饰性彩绘木天花板。萨比尔的窗户已被半砖封堵，但其中两个精美的花卉风格青铜格栅完好无损。上方库塔布周围的拱廊已被带有彩色玻璃灰泥格栅顶板的现代玻璃屏风封闭，但跟随萨比尔弯曲平面的双重屋檐（上层为扇贝形）未变。"

Maury (1983) suggests that this house, together with the house of Mustafa Gaf‘ar (no. 471), and the Khorazati house (U3), may at one time have been parts of a single huge dependency. The house has several large qa‘as, a maq‘ad, and a fine bathhouse. It was heavily restored by the Comité in the 1930s and further restored in 1998–2000. 这座庭院住宅在17世纪最初属于谢赫·塔布拉维（Shaykh al-Tablawi），后来转入谢赫·西海米（Shaykh al-Sihaymi）及其继承人手中；委员会称其为卡萨比（al-Kassabi）住宅。在开罗的房屋中，它不仅因其规模而不寻常，还因其房屋后面花园中保存了一些附属服务元素，如水车和谷物磨。花园还包含重建的马穆鲁克晚期贾马尔·丁（Gamal al-Din）陵墓，该陵墓有一个不寻常的穿孔圆顶，于1952年移至此地。Maury（1983）认为，这座房子连同穆斯塔法·加法尔住宅（编号471）和霍拉扎蒂住宅（U3），可能曾是同一个巨大庄园的一部分。房子有几个大卡阿、一个马卡德和一个精美的澡堂。它于1930年代由委员会大力修复，并于1998-2000年进一步修复。"

The structure behind the elaborate façade, however, is derelict and unused today. 这座建筑最初由赫兹（Herz，1914）及1915-19年公报列为阿布·扎哈布的维卡拉和“厨房”，但后者结构已被拆除，可能是在19世纪末建造阿布·扎哈布塔基亚（U27）时。该客栈（khan）在16世纪初似乎也属于奥斯曼总督苏莱曼帕夏。鲍蒂（Pauty，1931）称其为“刺绣工客栈”（khan al-Zarakisha）。委员会用新的马什拉比耶彻底翻新了侯赛因广场上的立面。然而，精致立面后面的结构今天已废弃未用。"

    "description": "This listing is here used to cover the Fatimid wall between the Bab al-Nasr and the Bab al-Futuh, which also extends some way to the west before being joined by the Ayyubid wall (see no. 307). It is also used for a small part of the wall appearing on map sheet 25 (below). Attached to the section of the wall running between the Bab al-Futuh and the Bab al-Nasr are three large square-fronted towers that are built of ashlar masonry over a rubble core, with columns set into them horizontally to provide reinforcement. The portion of the wall to the west of the Bab al-Futuh includes a square stone tower containing a staircase and a vast chamber with several reused pharaonic stone fragments, and another round-fronted tower. It was the wall that was the object of Creswell’s interest when he achieved, through the agency of the Comité in the 1940s, his aim of urban clearance outside the wall with a view to revealing its true appearance. This process included the demolition of the mosque of ‘Ayesha al-Sutuhiya (no. 558). The listing ‘352’ is applied today to all the city walls of Cairo indiscriminately whether of Fatimid of Ayyubid date, but this map reverts to the distinction found in the 1924 Map of Mohammedan Monuments of Cairo: no. 307 for Ayyubid walls and no. 352 for Fatimid walls. This small fragment of wall marks the line of the enceinte of Badr al-Gamali leading to the Bab al Qantara (U8). Heavily restored by the Comité, it is included for reference with the same registration number as the Fatimid walls between the Bab al-Nasr and the Bab al-Futuh. On this map sheet, the northwestern corner of the first mud-brick Fatimid enclosure wall of the city, built by Gawhar al-Siqilli, is clearly expressed in the surviving urban fabric, following the street to the north of Shari‘ Amir al Guyush and returning at a right angle heading south. 此名录在此用于涵盖纳斯尔门（Bab al-Nasr）和福图门（Bab al-Futuh）之间的法蒂玛城墙，该城墙也向西延伸了一段距离，然后与阿尤布城墙相连（见编号307）。它也用于出现在地图页25的一小部分墙体（见下文）。连接福图门和纳斯尔门之间城墙段的是三座大型方形正面塔楼，由方石砌体覆盖在碎石核心上建成，柱子水平嵌入其中以提供加固。福图门以西的城墙部分包括一座方形石塔（包含楼梯和带有几块重新利用的法老石碎片的巨大房间）和另一座圆形正面塔楼。正是这堵墙引起了克莱斯韦尔的兴趣，他在1940年代通过委员会实现了清理墙外城市区域的目标，以揭示其真实面貌。这一过程包括拆除阿伊莎·苏图希亚（‘Ayesha al-Sutuhiya）清真寺（编号558）。今天，“352”号名录不加区分地适用于开罗所有的城墙，无论是法蒂玛时期还是阿尤布时期，但本图恢复了1924年开罗穆罕默德古迹地图中的区别：编号307代表阿尤布城墙，编号352代表法蒂玛城墙。这一小段墙体标志着通往坎塔拉门（U8）的巴德尔·贾马利防御圈的线路。经委员会大力修复，它以与纳斯尔门和福图门之间的法蒂玛城墙相同的登记号列入参考。在这张地图页上，由乔哈尔·西奇利建造的城市第一道泥砖法蒂玛围墙的西北角在幸存的城市肌理中清晰可见，沿着阿米尔·古尤什街（Shari‘ Amir al Guyush）以北的街道延伸，并成直角向南折回。"

The mihrab has an original carved inscription above it, which has also been covered in paint. 索引中给出的该古迹日期似乎源自建筑物立面上记录公元17世纪修复工程的一处铭文。陵墓本身可能要古老得多，可能追溯到15世纪初，这是扎维亚基布拉墙上瓷砖的日期。陵墓顶部有一个小石圆顶，基部有一圈铭文带。除了马穆鲁克瓷砖外，基布拉墙还有镶嵌的大理石板，但被重绘覆盖而模糊不清。米哈拉布上方有原始雕刻铭文，也被油漆覆盖。"

A restored street-covering spans to the western section of the complex (no. 406). All the units in this northern block of the Radwan Bey’s development are derelict, and the original façade of the block facing the mosque of al-Mu’ayyad Shaykh was truncated by the widening of the street in the early part of the twentieth century. 最初的名录一定是指法拉吉·伊本·巴尔库克萨比尔和扎维亚（编号203）紧南侧街区的立面，该街区于1929年由委员会重建。该街区在其西南角包含一个单独的房屋单元，并构成拉德万·贝伊原始开发项目的一部分（见编号406-408）。一个修复后的街道覆盖物跨越到建筑群的西段（编号406）。拉德万·贝伊开发项目北街区的所有单元都已废弃，面向穆阿亚德·谢赫清真寺的街区原始立面因20世纪初的街道拓宽而被截断。"

The mosque, with an Ottoman-style minaret, has arched stone riwaqs supported on purpose-made marble columns, carved with the royal crescent, with bronze collars. Within the riwaqs stand the cenotaphs of three shaykhs. The qibla wall has a fine inlaid marble dado and mihrab, surmounted at its center by a stone maqsura dome. 关于这座穆罕默德·阿里时期的清真寺知之甚少。入口大门毗邻另一座通往住宅庭院的精美石刻大门。很有可能这就是共享该名录的立面。在清真寺前面的庭院里有一个萨比尔，配有精美的青铜格栅和饮水口。这座带有奥斯曼风格宣礼塔的清真寺拥有拱形石回廊（riwaqs），由特制的大理石柱支撑，柱上刻有皇家新月标志，并带有青铜项圈。在回廊内矗立着三位谢赫的衣冠冢。基布拉墙有精美的镶嵌大理石护壁和米哈拉布，中心上方是一个石制马克苏拉（maqsura）圆顶。"

It has two iwans that are, unusually, enclosed by tunnel vaults of plastered brick rather than flat timber ceilings. The central lantern has collapsed. The walls are made of stone; remains of a wooden inscription band survive around the perimeter of the room. The plan represented on map sheet 13 is archival, as many of the outlying sections of the palace have now disintegrated. The qa‘a derives its name from the shaykh who is buried nearby (see U29) and was registered in 1927. In 2000 it was occupied by a carpenter’s workshop. 该结构是一座早期宫殿的仅存部分，曾在奥斯曼时期重建。该建筑的确切年代一直存在争议（总结于O’Kane 2000）。它有两个伊万，不寻常的是，它们由灰泥砖的筒形拱顶封闭，而不是平坦的木材天花板。中央灯笼天窗已坍塌。墙壁由石头制成；房间周边残留着木制铭文带。地图页13上显示的平面图是档案资料，因为宫殿的许多外围部分现在已经瓦解。这个卡阿（qa‘a）的名字源于葬在附近的谢赫（见U29），并于1927年登记。2000年时，它被一个木工车间占用。"

Salah al-Din chose the site for the first khanqah in Egypt, and it became a major center for Sufism, known as the Salahiya. The present structure appears to date to the nineteenth century, perhaps incorporating traces of earlier buildings. The mosque has an unusual plan, with four covered prayer halls arranged around an open courtyard, accessed by a dog-legged corridor. Of the three surviving halls, that to the south has arcades with marble columns, while those to the east and west have stone piers and arches. The collapsed northern section may have had columns to match its southern counterpart. The bathhouse attached to the mosque is commonly called the hammam al Gamaliya (U4). 这座清真寺建在一座法蒂玛宫殿的遗址上，该宫殿由哈里发穆斯坦绥尔的获释奴隶赛义德（Sa‘id）于公元11世纪后期建立。萨拉赫·丁（Salah al-Din）选择了这个地点作为埃及的第一座汗卡（khanqah），它成为了一个主要的苏菲主义中心，被称为萨拉希亚（Salahiya）。目前的结构似乎可以追溯到19世纪，可能融合了早期建筑的痕迹。清真寺的布局不同寻常，有四个有顶的祈祷大厅围绕着一个开放的庭院，通过一条折形走廊进入。在幸存的三个大厅中，南面的大厅有带大理石柱的拱廊，而东面和西面的大厅则有石墩和拱门。已倒塌的北段可能曾拥有与其南部对应部分相匹配的柱子。附属于清真寺的澡堂通常被称为盖马利亚澡堂（hammam al Gamaliya，U4）。"

From the fourteenth century until 1660, it served as the seat of the Coptic patriarchate. The church is located some four meters below present ground level, which is further evidence for the antiquity of the foundation. The plan of the church is basilical, with a narthex and three sanctuaries. The nave is lined with antique columns, and the roof above it has a wooden barrel vault. The major problem affecting the church is water: it is below the water table, and constant pumping is required to avoid flooding. 这个古老的建筑群包括圣母玛利亚教堂及其附属修道院、圣梅尔库里乌斯（St. Mercurius）教堂和圣乔治教堂。前者是这些结构中最古老的，其地基可能追溯到公元10世纪；然而，大多数可见的结构是18世纪的。从14世纪直到1660年，它一直是科普特教皇的驻地。教堂位于目前地面以下约四米处，这是其地基古老的进一步证据。教堂的平面是巴西利卡式的，有一个前廊和三个圣所。中殿排列着古董柱，上方的屋顶有木制筒形拱顶。影响教堂的主要问题是水：它位于地下水位以下，需要不断抽水以避免淹水。"

The eastern portal provides access to the male section of the bathhouse. An adjacent, smaller women’s bathhouse of the same period is accessed by the slightly smaller western portal. Only the corbels of the building’s upper story survive. Both male and female sections of the bathhouse are still in use despite the extreme degradation of the fabric of the building internally and externally. The bathhouse was also registered under the number (490) together with the house that once stood above it. 这座澡堂可能追溯到更早的时期，但由于重建对于澡堂来说很常见，目前的建筑很可能是奥斯曼时期的，这一点得到了诸如立面石装饰等风格细节的证实。立面由两个带有方形穆卡纳斯罩的入口组成；它们之间的两个圆拱窗由装饰线条框住。东入口通往澡堂的男性区域。同一时期相邻的较小女性澡堂通过稍小的西入口进入。只有建筑上层的牛腿幸存。尽管建筑内外部结构极度退化，澡堂的男性和女性区域仍在使用中。该澡堂还曾与曾经位于其上方的房屋一起以编号（490）登记。"

The bathhouse was at one time in the waqf of Qalawun; it passed into the hands of Nafisa al-Bayda, who owned the adjacent wikala (no. 395), in the late eighteenth century. Only the men’s half of the bath house survives, its entrance located on the Sukkariya. This was in use until recently, and it conforms to the standard model of Cairene bathhouse, with a disrobing room and central domed space, off of which lie the smaller domed tank rooms. The women’s section was accessed from the small alley (known as the ‘Atfat al-Hammam) running to the north of the wikala of Nafisa al-Bayda. 自公元12世纪以来，一座以卡迪·法迪尔（Qadi al-Fadil）名义建立的男女双重澡堂就一直矗立在这个地点。目前的结构可能是后来的重建。该澡堂曾一度属于卡拉温的瓦克夫；18世纪后期，它落入拥有相邻维卡拉（编号395）的纳菲萨·拜达手中。只有澡堂的男性一半幸存下来，其入口位于Sukkariya。这直到最近仍在使用，符合开罗澡堂的标准模式，有一个更衣室和中央圆顶空间，旁边是较小的圆顶水箱房。女性区域是从纳菲萨·拜达维卡拉北面的一条小巷（称为‘Atfat al-Hammam）进入的。"

The Comité first assigned this wikala the number 500, which had already been given to the façade of the house of al-Kashif; it was subse quently given a new registration number. 该建筑的立面、入口和入口通道在1933年至1935年间被分类。维卡拉的内部目前被煤冶炼厂和金属加工行业占用，已基本被毁。Raymond和Wiet（1979）认为这可能是《埃及记述》中提到的作为金匠维卡拉的wikalat al-Khatib。更可能是Hanna（1998）的归属，即该维卡拉是商人Isma‘il Abu Takiya及其合伙人在17世纪建造的一对维卡拉之一（见编号179）。委员会最初将该维卡拉分配为500号，该编号已被给予al-Kashif房屋的立面；随后它被给予了一个新的登记号。"

The position of the Ayyubid Bab al-Barqiya is probably the gate recently discovered slight ly to the south, and the confusion is compounded by the pres ence in the vicinity of both the Fatimid Bab al-Tawfiq (see U10), and the Bab al-Khala (no.
